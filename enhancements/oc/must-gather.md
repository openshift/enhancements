# Must-Gather

## Release Signoff Checklist

- [ ] Enhancement is `implementable`
- [ ] Design details are appropriately documented from clear requirements
- [ ] Test plan is defined
- [ ] Graduation criteria for dev preview, tech preview, GA
- [ ] User-facing documentation is created in [openshift-docs](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/)

## Summary

To debug something broken in the cluster, it is important to have a single command for an unskilled customer to run that
gathers all the information we may need to solve the problem.  If you're familiar with `sosreport`, the idea is to have
that, but focused on a kuberentes cluster instead of a host.  We need avoid the versioning skew complexity and the scaling
problems inherent in a shared repo with input from multiple products.

## Motivation

Gather everything.  Software breaks and you aren't smart enough to know exactly what you need to debug the problem ahead of time.  You figure
that out *after* you've debugged the problem.  This tool is about the first shotgun gathering so you only have to ask the
customer once.

It must be simple.  You're gathering because your software is buggy and hard to use.  The more complex your gathering software, the more likely
it is that the gathering software fails too.  Simplify your gathering software by only using a matching version of the gathering tool.
This simplifies code and test matrices so that your tool always works.  For instance, OpenShift payloads include the exact 
level of gathering used to debug that payload.

Own your destiny.  You own shipping your own software.  If you can be trusted to ship your software, you can be trusted
to ship your gathering tool to match it, don't let your gathering be gated by another product.  It may seems easier to start,
but ultimately you'll end up constrained by different motivations, styles, and cadences.  If you can ship one image, you can
ship a second one.   

### Goals

1. Gathering should exactly match a single version of the product it is inspecting.
2. Different products should be responsible for gathering for their own components.
3. Introspection for clusteroperators should be largely automatic, covering a broad range of generic use-cases.
4. A single, low-arg client command for users. 
5. In a failing cluster, gathering should be maximized to collect everything it can even when part of it fails.
6. CEE should own the gather script itself, since they are the first consumers.

### Non-Goals

## Proposal

`must-gather` for openshift is a combination of three tools:

1. A client-side `inspect` command that works like a super-get.  It has semantic understand of some resources and traverses
   links to get interesting information beyond the current.  Pods in namespaces and logs for those pods as a for instance.
   Currently this is `openshift-must-gather inspect`, but we are porting this to `oc adm` as experiemental in 4.3.  We may
   change and extend arguments over time, but the intent of the command will remain.
2. The openshift-must-gather image, produced from https://github.com/openshift/must-gather.  The entry point is a 
   [/gather bash script](https://github.com/openshift/must-gather/blob/master/collection-scripts/gather) owned by CEE 
   (not the developers) that describes what to gather.  It is tightly coupled to the openshift payload
   and only contains logic to gather information from that payload.  We have e2e tests that make sure this functions.
3. `oc adm must-gather --image` which is a client-side tool that runs any must-gather compatible image by creating a pod,
   running the `/usr/bin/gather` binary, and then rsyncing the `/must-gather` and includes the logs of the pod.

### `inspect`

See the [inspect enhancement](inspect.md) for details on the `inspect` command. 

### must-gather Images

To provide your own must-gather image, it must....

1. Must have a zero-arg, executable file at `/usr/bin/gather` that does your default gathering
2. Must produce data to be copied back at `/must-gather`.  The data must not contain any sensitive data.  We don't string PII information, only secret information.
3. Must produce a text `/must-gather/version` that indicates the product (first line) and the version (second line, `major.minor.micro.qualifier`),
   so that programmatic analysis can be developed.

### local fall-back

If the `oc adm must-gather` tool's pod cannot be scheduled or run on the cluster, the `oc adm must-gather` tool will, after a timeout, fall-back to running `oc adm inspect clusteroperators` locally. 

### User Stories

### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints

What are the caveats to the implementation? What are some important details that
didn't come across above. Go in to as much detail as necessary here. This might
be a good place to talk about core concepts and how they releate.

### Risks and Mitigations

What are the risks of this proposal and how do we mitigate. Think broadly. For
example, consider both security and how this will impact the larger OKD
ecosystem.

How will security be reviewed and by whom? How will UX be reviewed and by whom?

Consider including folks that also work outside your immediate sub-project.

## Design Details

This is subject to change, but today we do this by running the must-gather image in an init containers and then we have
a container that sleeps forever.  We download the result and then delete the namespace to cleanup.

### Output Format

The output of a must-gather image is up the component producing the image, but this is how the openshift/must-gather is 
currently organized.

```
├── audit_logs
│   ├── kube-apiserver
│   │   ├── zipped audit files from each master here
│   ├── openshift-apiserver
│   │   ├── zipped audit files from each master here
├── host_service_logs
│   └── masters
│       ├── crio_service.log
│       └── kubelet_service.log
└── <inspect cmd output>
...
```

### Test Plan

There is an e2e test that makes sure the command always exits successfully and that certain apsects of the content
are always present. 

### Graduation Criteria

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

The image is included in the payload, but has no content running in a cluster to upgrade.

### Version Skew Strategy

The `oc` command must skew +/- one like normal commands.
