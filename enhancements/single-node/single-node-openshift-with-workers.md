# Single Node OpenShift With Workers

## Summary

This enhancement aims to enable adding workers to a single control-plane node
cluster by attempting to tackle multiple issues that arise when worker nodes
are added to such clusters.

## Motivation

Today OCP supports deploying a cluster which only has a single control-plane
node and no additional workers.

There's been recent demand for OCP to also formally support deployment of
single control-plane node clusters with additional (non control-plane) worker
nodes.

This is already easily done on (unsupported) cloud IPI-deployed single
control-plane node clusters by increasing the replica count of one of the
worker machinesets (there are multiple machinesets provided by default on cloud
clusters, one for each AZ, and in cloud single control-plane node clusters
they're both simply scaled to 0 by default). Doing this results in a single
control-plane node cluster with additional workers and that cluster works as
expected without any known issues.

Even on Assisted Installer installed single control-plane node clusters it's
trivial to add more workers by leveraging the Assisted Installer's day-2 worker
installation capabilities (after some minor DNS configuration issues which will
be improved by the Assisted Installer team, separately from this enhancement).

OCP installations have an `infrastructures.config.openshift.io` CR
automatically deployed by the installer. This CR has two topology fields in
its status called "Control Plane Topology" and "Infrastructure Topology" which,
as of today, may have one of three values:

- `SingleReplica`
- `HighlyAvailable`
- `External` (this value is unrelated to this enhancement and is only mentioned here for completeness' sake)

(See "see-also" enhancements links for more information about the topology
fields and their possible values)

The "Control Plane Topology" field is used by control-plane operators (such
as the Cluster etcd Operator) to determine how many replicas they should give
their various Deployments / StatefulSets. The value of this field in single
control-plane node clusters is always simply `SingleReplica`.

The "Infrastructure Topology" field is used by infrastructure operators
(such as the Cluster Ingress Operator or Cluster Monitoring Operator) to
determine how many replicas they should give their various Deployments /
StatefulSets. The value of this field is a function of how many workers
were present during installation.

On "none"-platform single control-plane node clusters, when adding
workers, the resulting cluster has an issue with the behavior of the ingress
pod, the following paragraphs explain the background for this issue and the
issue itself.

One of the benefits of installing single-node clusters is the simplicity of not
having to deal with load-balancing and virtual IPs, as these don't provide much
value when there's only a single node behind them.

As a result, current common ways of installing single control-plane node
clusters today (mainly the Assisted Installer) avoid the usage of load
balancers or virtual IPs for API and ingress. There has also been some recent
effort to determine how single control-plane node cluster deployments on clouds
may be adjusted in order to reduce their costs, and one of the conclusions is
that getting rid of the load balancer installed by default by the IPI installer
results in major cost savings.

A user installing a single control-plane node cluster on "none"-platform will
be tempted to simply point their DNS entries directly at the IP address of the
single node that they just installed.

Similarly, in the Assisted Installer, the user is able to complete the
installation without needing to define any DNS entries. This is currently made
possible by injecting a `MachineConfig` manifest targeting the "master" pool
containing configuration for a dnsmasq server. The dnsmasq server is configured
with DNS entries for `api.<cluster>.<base>`, `api-int.<cluster>.<base>` and
`*.apps.<cluster>.<base>` which all point to the single control-plane node's IP
address. This allows the installation process and the resulting cluster to
conveniently work without the user having to think about and configure DNS for
their cluster (of course external access to the cluster requires the user to
configure DNS, but this can be done separately after the installation has
completed).

The issue with those approaches is that they assume that
`*.apps.<cluster>.<base>` should always point at the single control-plane
node's IP address. This is of course correct when there's just that single node
in the cluster, but once you start adding worker nodes to the cluster it starts
causing a potential problem - the `router-default` deployment created by the
Cluster Ingress Operator, which is responsible for load balancing ingress
traffic, targets the "worker" pool using a node selector. As a result, under
some circumstances, that deployment's pod may eventually find itself running
also on the newly added worker nodes, as those nodes obviously also belong to
the worker pool (the reason the control-plane node was also in the worker pool
is that when during installation there are no worker nodes, the OpenShift
installer sets the Scheduler CR `.spec.mastersSchedulable` to `true` and as a
result the control-plane node is in both the "master" and "worker" pools).

This pod floating between the nodes is a problem because user ingress traffic
has to be directed at the node currently holding the `router-default` pods, and
since the DNS entries have been "naively" pointed at the original control-plane
node's IP address (which may no longer be running those pods), ingress traffic
may no longer work. This can be temporarily solved if DNS is adjusted to point
at the correct node currently holding the pod or a load-balancer / some virtual
IP solution is put in place and then the DNS entry can be directed at that
load-balancer / virtual IP instead of at the node. This enhancement will try
to prevent this floating altogether so these workarounds will not be needed.

Finally, performing bootstrap-in-place installation of a "none"-platform single
control-plane node cluster today using the OpenShift Installer does not provide
the user with a worker node ignition file. As a result, the user is not able to
manually add worker nodes to the resulting cluster. All current official OCP
documentation points the user to use "the worker ignition file that get
generated during installation", but that is not currently generated in such
bootstrap-in-place installation.

### Goals

- Deal with the "floating ingress" issue encountered in "none"-platform
single control-plane node clusters which have worker nodes added to them.

- Define how the installer may be modified to generate the worker ignition
manifest, even when doing bootstrap-in-place "none"-platform single
control-plane node cluster installation

### Non-Goals

- Deal with the scalability of single control-plane node clusters that have
additional workers added to them. The absence of multiple control-plane nodes
means that the number of workers/pods that can be supported on such a topology
is even more limited than in a regular 3 control-plane node cluster. Relevant
documentation may have to point out that the pod limits (or other control-plane
related limits) that apply to a single control-plane node cluster with no
workers also apply globally across all additional added workers. If a large
amount of workers/pods is desired the user would have to re-install the cluster
as a regular multi control-plane node cluster.

- Deal with clusters that have less nodes than they had during day-1
installation. The rationale for this being a non-goal is that it seems that
removing the "initial" nodes of a cluster causes a lot of issues even in a
regular, multi-node installation. So dealing with similar issues in single
control-plane node clusters is also out of scope for this enhancement. For
example, installing a cluster with 3 control-plane nodes and 3 workers results
in unschedulable control-plane nodes. Scaling down the worker machine-sets from
3 to 0 post-installation does not magically make the control-plane nodes
schedulable, and as a result a lot of infrastructure workloads fail to schedule
and operators degrade. User intervention is required to fix this.

- Deal with expansion of the single-node control-plane by adding more
control-plane nodes

- Deal with expansion of clusters that have been installed before the
implementation of this enhancement (if possible, their expansion may be
addressed by an upgrade followed with documentation outlining the steps that
the user has to take to enable expansion, e.g. patch the default
`IngressController` to have node selector targetting the master pool rather
than the worker pool).

- Adjust the baremetal platform to support single control-plane node
installations. The baremetal platform solves the "floating ingress" issue by
using virtual IP addresses/keepalived.

- Deal with users who want their ingress traffic to not go through the single
control-plane node. Such users can easily achieve that goal by modifying the
`IngressController` to target just the worker, non-control-plane node(s)
(perhaps by labeling all of them with a unique label that is not applied to the
control-plane node that is also a worker and then have the `IngressController`
target that label).

- Deal with non-cloud, non-"none" platforms such as baremetal, vSphere, etc.

## Proposal

- Create a new `DefaultPlacement` API field.

- Make sure worker node ignition files are generated even in bootstrap-in-place
single control-plane node "none"-platform installation.

### User Stories

- As an OpenShift cluster administrator, I want to install a single control-plane
node cluster with additional worker nodes, so that my cluster will be able to
handle larger computation demands.

- As an OpenShift cluster administrator, I want to add worker nodes to my
existing single control-plane node cluster, so that it'll be able to meet
growing computation demands.

### API Extensions

Introduce a new status field in the Ingress config CR
(`config.openshift.io/v1/ingresses`) called `DefaultPlacement`.

In addition, continue to allow the `.spec.replicas` and `.spec.nodePlacement`
fields in `operator.openshift.io/v1/ingresscontrollers` CRs to be omitted, but
change the "controller-defaulting" behavior for these fields to be  based on
this new status field. This means that when the Cluster Ingress Operator
creates router `Deployments` out of `IngressController` resources it will
adjust how it behaves in the absence of these parameters. The exact details of
this behavior are described below.

The goal of this new `DefaultPlacement` field is to give the installer a way to
affect the general placement of the `IngressController`. This is regardless of
whether an `IngressController` is created during installation with the
`.spec.replicas` and `.spec.nodePlacement` omitted or whether no
`IngressController` was created during an installation at all. Today, when no
`IngressController` is created during installation, the Cluster Ingress Operator
creates a default `IngressController`, in this case we can go one of two ways -

- The Cluster Ingress Operator leaves those fields empty in the newly created
`IngressController`

- The cluster Ingress Operator populates these fields in the newly created
`IngressController`

Choosing one way or the other is arbitrary and shouldn't matter due to the
immutable nature of this new field - the eventual `Deployment` that gets
created would be identical in any case. I personally prefer the second option
since it makes the fields explicit in the `IngressController` itself and not
just in `Deployments` that get created.

The sections below go into detail about the field, its possible values, and the
behavior expected from each of them, but in practice following is the proposed
addition to `openshift/api`'s `config/v1/types_ingress.go` file:

```go
type IngressStatus struct {
	// ... existing fields omitted

	// defaultPlacement is set at installation time to control which
	// nodes will host the ingress router pods by default. The options are
	// control-plane nodes or worker nodes.
	//
	// This field works by dictating how the Cluster Ingress Operator will 
	// consider unset replicas and nodePlacement fields in IngressController
	// resources when creating the corresponding Deployments.
	//
	// See the documentation for the IngressController replicas and nodePlacement
	// fields for more information.
	//
	// When omitted, the default value is Workers
	//
	// +kubebuilder:validation:Enum:="ControlPlane";"Workers"
	// +kubebuilder:default:="Workers"
	// +optional
	DefaultPlacement DefaultPlacement `json:"defaultPlacement"`

	// ... existing fields omitted
}

// DefaultPlacement defines the default placement of ingress router pods.
type DefaultPlacement string

const (
	// "Workers" is for having router pods placed on worker nodes by default
	DefaultPlacementWorkers DefaultPlacement = "Workers"

	// "ControlPlane" is for having router pods placed on control-plane nodes by default
	DefaultPlacementControlPlane DefaultPlacement = "ControlPlane"
)
```

And the following documentation update to the `openshift/api`'s `operator/v1/types_ingress.go` file:

```go
type IngressControllerSpec struct {
	// ... existing fields omitted

	// replicas is the desired number of ingress controller replicas. If unset,
	// the default depends on the value of the defaultPlacement field in the 
	// cluster config.openshift.io/v1/ingresses status. 
	//
	// The value of replicas is set based on the value of a chosen field in the
	// Infrastructure CR. If defaultPlacement is set to ControlPlane, the
	// chosen field will be controlPlaneTopology. If it is set to Workers the
	// chosen field will be infrastructureTopology. Replicas will then be set to 1
	// or 2 based whether the chosen field's value is SingleReplica or
	// HighlyAvailable, respectively.
	//
	// +optional
	Replicas *int32 `json:"replicas,omitempty"`

	// ... existing fields omitted
}

type NodePlacement struct {
	// ... existing fields omitted

	// nodeSelector is the node selector applied to ingress controller
	// deployments.
	//
	// If set, the specified selector is used and replaces the default.
	// 
	// If unset, the default depends on the value of the defaultPlacement
	// field in the cluster config.openshift.io/v1/ingresses status.
	// 
	// When defaultPlacement is Workers, the default is:
	//
	//   kubernetes.io/os: linux
	//   node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ''
	//
	// When defaultPlacement is ControlPlane, the default is:
	//
	//   kubernetes.io/os: linux
	//   node-role.kubernetes.io/master: ''
	//
	// +optional
	NodeSelector *metav1.LabelSelector `json:"nodeSelector,omitempty"`

	// ... existing fields omitted
}
```

### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints

This new field will have one of these values - `ControlPlane` or `Workers`.
There are no current plans for any more values, but more may be added in the
future.

When the value of `DefaultPlacement` is `Workers`, the defaulting
behavior of `.spec.replicas` and `.spec.nodePlacement` will be the same as it
is today: `.spec.replicas` will be treated according to the value of
`InfrastructureTopology`, namely `1` when `SingleReplica` or `2` when
`HighlyAvailable`. `.spec.nodePlacement` will always just be:

```yaml
nodePlacement:
  nodeSelector:
    matchLabels:
      kubernetes.io/os: linux
      node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ''
```

However, if the value of `DefaultPlacement` is `ControlPlane`, the
defaulting behavior will be different: `.spec.replicas` will be treated instead
according to the value of `ControlPlaneTopology`; again, `1` when
`SingleReplica` or `2` when `HighlyAvailable`. `.spec.nodePlacement` will be
always just be:

```yaml
nodePlacement:
  nodeSelector:
    matchLabels:
      kubernetes.io/os: linux
      node-role.kubernetes.io/master: ''
```

(Note that the `kubernetes.io/os: linux` label is mentioned just because it's
the current behavior, it has no importance in this enhancement)

The installer will detect situations in which it's unlikely the user will want
to set up a load-balancer. For now, those situations only include installation
of single control-plane node cluster deployments on the "none" platform. In
those situations, the installer will set `DefaultPlacement` to be
`ControlPlane`. Since there's just a single control-plane node, `ControlPlane`
topology would be `SingleReplica` and the combined effect would be that the
`IngressController` will have just a single replica and be pinned to the single
control-plane node. This will then ensure that the `router-default` deployment
created by the Cluster Ingress Operator will always run on the single
control-plane node, and as a result any `*.apps.<cluster>.<base>` DNS entries
which originally pointed at the single control-plane node will remain correct
even in the face of newly added worker nodes.

In any other situations, the installer will set `DefaultPlacement` to
`Workers`, resulting in the same default behavior as before this enhancement,
namely that `IngressController` pods are scheduled on worker nodes and their
number of replicas determined according to the `InfrastructureTopology`.

If the value of `DefaultPlacement` itself is omitted, it is defaulted to
`Workers`. This would be useful in order to maintain the current behavior if
the API/Ingress PR is merged before the installer PR to set this field.

The installer may not set `DefaultPlacement` to `ControlPlane` when the
cluster's `ControlPlaneTopology` is set to `External`.

In the future, when IPI-installed single control-plane node clusters in the
cloud no longer provision a load-balancer by default, they would also benefit
from having the installer set the `DefaultPlacement` to `ControlPlane`.

### Risks and Mitigations

This should make no noticable difference on "regular" single control-plane node
clusters which do not have any day-1 or day-2 worker nodes. The only difference
for those clusters would be the `IngressController` targeting the "master" pool
rather than the "worker" pool, but since the single control-plane node is
already both in the "master" and "worker" pools, that should make no practical
difference.

On multi-node clusters, the installer will never set the
`DefaultPlacement` field to `ControlPlane`, so there are no risks to
discuss for multi-node clusters in this enhancement. However, any future
enhancement that will consider making this field configurable by allowing
the user to set it during installation, should take into account that the
documentation / installation process for the load balancers would have to take
this field into account when choosing which nodes the load balancer should
target.

I do not believe this enhancement has any security implications.

## Design Details

### Open Questions

None that I can think of at the moment

### Test Plan

#### General tests

- Add unit tests to the Cluster Ingress Operator to make sure the
IngressController resource and corresponding Deployment is generated as
exepected.

- Add tests on both cloud / "none"-platform that check that a single-node cluster
with additional workers recovers after the single control-plane node reboots by
running conformance tests post-reboot.

- Add tests on both cloud / "none"-platform that check that a single-node cluster
with additional workers recovers after an upgrade by running conformance tests
post-upgrade.

#### Day-2 workers tests

- Add periodic nightly tests which install single-node in the cloud, add a few
worker nodes to it, then run conformance tests to make sure we don't run into
any problems not described in this enhancement.

- Add periodic nightly tests which install a single-node "none"-platform cluster,
add worker nodes to it, and check that ingress traffic still works as expected
and recovers even after the `router-default` pod gets deleted and rescheduled.

#### Day-1 workers tests

- Add periodic nightly tests which install a single control-plane node cluster
with a few additional workers in the cloud, then run conformance tests to make
sure we don't run into any problems not described in this enhancement.

- Add periodic nightly tests which install a single control-plane "none"-platform
cluster with additional workers and check that ingress traffic still works as
expected and recovers even after the `router-default` pod gets deleted and
rescheduled. 

### Graduation Criteria

**Note:** *Section not required until targeted at a release.*

TBD

#### Dev Preview -> Tech Preview

TBD

#### Tech Preview -> GA

TBD

#### Removing a deprecated feature

N/A

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

The new `DefaultPlacement` API field will have a default value of `Workers`.
The behavior of the Cluster Ingress Operator when the `DefaultPlacement` field
has the value `Workers` should be identical to its current behavior (before
this enhancement). This means that clusters that go through an upgrade from a
version before this enhancement to a later version which includes this
enhancement will maintain their current behavior, this enhancement should not
change anything for them.

If the value of `DefaultPlacement` is unset the Cluster Ingress Operator should
make sure to treat it as if it were to have the value `Workers`.

### Version Skew Strategy

Does not apply, to the best of my understanding.

### Operational Aspects of API Extensions

- Since the `DefaultPlacement` field is part of the status of the
Ingress config CR, it is clear that users should not modify this field.

- This API change only affects the defaulting behavior of the `IngressController`
CR, it does not add any new capabilities to OCP, or give any more flexibility
than there already was.

For administrators and support engineers, the `IngressController` is still the
source of truth and where you need to look if you seek to understand the router
placement in practice. However, now the absence of `replicas` and
`nodePlacement` in the `IngressController` resource has a different meaning
(and that meaning depends on the new `DefaultPlacement` parameter), so
administrators and support engineers can refer to the corresponding Deployment
that got created if they wish to know the values in practice. This could
potentially be improved if the Cluster Ingress Operator would always strive to
reconcile these defaults to also appear in the `IngressController` CRs
themselves. The decision is left for the Cluster Ingress Operator's
implementation.

#### Failure Modes

- The `ControlPlane` value of the `DefaultPlacement` field value may
not be used if the cluster's `ControlPlaneTopology` field is set to `External`.
The Cluster Ingress Operator would treat such combination as if the
`DefaultPlacement` value is actually `Workers` instead, and log a warning to
indicate that this invalid combination has been detected. The Cluster Ingress
Operator should not fail to reconcile `IngressController` CRs due to this
invalid combination. This should not happen under any circumstance since the
installer will never set this combination, but the Cluster Ingress Operator
should still handle it gracefully regardless.

#### Support Procedures

- For administrators and support engineers, the `IngressController` is still the source
of truth and where you need to look for understanding the router placement in practice.
Nothing has changed in that regard.

## Implementation History

Not yet applicable

## Drawbacks

- The pinning of the `IngressController` to the "master" pool is another change
which would make single-node clusters slightly different from multi-node
clusters, and any such difference is naturally not ideal.

- The proposed defaulting behavior for the discussed `IngressController`
fields is complicated and dependent on three different fields (infra
topology, control-plane topology, and ingress placement) - such complexity
would probably have to be documented in the CRD definitions and may confuse
users.

## Alternatives

- Instead of adding this new `DefaultPlacement` field to the Ingress config CR,
add two new status fields to the Ingress config CR, one for the `replicas`
value recommended by the installation process and one for the `nodePlacement`
value recommended by the installation process. This way instead of the
installation process deciding on a generalized `defaultPlacement` with values
of `Workers` and `ControlPlane` it would instead give more specific
instructions to the Cluster Ingress Operator of how it thinks those unset
parameters should be defaulted. Due to the complexity of the nodePlacement
parameter, having the installation process dictate its value directly requires
the installation process to be aware of things like the [Linux label](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-ingress-operator/blob/a6c16b7eefe6d7045f3109cd265c4e891f5791ef/pkg/operator/controller/ingress/deployment.go#L569)
that the Ingress Operator would otherwise set by default on Deployments.

- Even when users need to add just one extra worker, require them to add yet
another worker so they could just form a compact 3-node cluster where all nodes
are both workers and control-plane nodes. This kind of topology is already
supported by OCP. This will avoid the need for OCP to support yet another
topology. It has the obvious downside of requiring a "useless" node the user
didn't really need. It also means the user now has to run more control-plane
workloads to facilitate HA - for example, 2 extra replicas of the API server
which consume a lot of memory resources. From an engineering perspective, it
would require us to make the "Control-plane Topology" field dynamic and make
sure all operators know to react to changes in that field (it will have to
change from `SingleReplica` to `HighlyAvailable` once those 2 new control-plane
nodes join the cluster). I am not aware of the other engineering difficulties
we would encounter when attempting to support the expansion of a single-node
control-plane into a three-node control-plane, but I think they would not be
trivial.

- Adjust the "baremetal" platform to support single control-plane node
installations and make users and the Assisted Installer (the current popular,
supported method to install single control-plane node clusters) use that
platform instead of the "none" platform. The baremetal platform solves the
issue described in this enhancement with virtual IP addresses/keepalived. This
approach was dismissed due to much higher development efforts and additional
processes that would need to run on the already resource constrained single
control-plane node. Furthermore, even once the baremetal platform is adjusted
to support single-node clusters, the Assisted Installer would have to go
through a lot of development effort in order to make it use the baremetal
platform rather than the "none" platform currently used for single node
installations. This may happen in the future.
