# Automatic detection of Disks in the Local-Storage-Operator

## Release Signoff Checklist

- [ ] Enhancement is `implementable`
- [ ] Design details are appropriately documented from clear requirements
- [ ] Test plan is defined
- [ ] Graduation criteria for dev preview, tech preview, GA
- [ ] User-facing documentation is created in [openshift-docs](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/)

## Summary

This is a proposal to enable
- automated discovery of local disks via the `LocalVolumeDiscovery` CR and exposing the result via `LocalVolumeDiscoveryResult` CR.
- automated provisioning of LocalPVs sorting them into StorageClasses based on their characteristics via the `LocalVolumeSet` CRD.

This CRD will be implemented in the LocalStorageOperator(LSO)

## Motivation

The existing method of manually managing disks on nodes does not scale, and cannot be consumed by another operator.
Choosing devices to be used should be handled on the platform so that multiple consumers of local storage don't conflict.
To enable layering, we need information about potential devices, so that we have information about availability,
and we can use that information to sort devices into storage classes based on their capabilities.

### Goals

- Discovery of potentially usable local disks on chosen nodes.
- Automatic sorting of available disks into StorageClasses based on their characteristics.
- Detect newly attached disks

### Non-Goals

- Inherently protect against confilict with provisioners that own local devices on the same nodes automatic detection is configured to run.

### Risks and Mitigations
- There is a risk that LSO detects a volume that contains data and we mitigate this risk by ensuring that the device:
  - can be openened exclusively.
  - is not read-only.
  - is not removable.
  - has no child partitions.
  - has no FS signature.
  - state (as outputted by `lsblk`) is not `suspended`
- There is a risk that LSO will detect just attached device as empty, before kubelet formats it, we mitigate this risk
  - by re-checking the device after ~1 minute.
- There is a risk that the path of the disk changes after reboot and disk can be re-detected as new, we mitigate this risk by
  - Using disk id for symlink.
- There is a risk that LSO will match all local disks that already have PVs, but these PVs are not bound / used yet.`
  - Skip the devices that already have PVs provisioned on them.
- There is a risk that multiple `LocalVolumeSet` and `LocalVolume` CRs will use the same device.
  - Skip the devices that already have PVs provisioned on them.
- There is a risk that LSO may create PV for a device/disk that's already used as another PV.
  - We can solve this by updating local-storage-static-provisioner to hash localPVs using hostname and disk name and remove the storageclass.

## Proposal

The `local-storage-operator` is already capable of consuming local disks from the nodes and provisioning PVs out of them, but the disk/device paths needs to explicitly specified in the `LocalVolume` CR.
The idea is to introduce two new features in LSO
- Auto discovery of local devices
  - This will introduce two new CRs `LocalVolumeDiscovery` and `LocalVolumeDiscoveryResult`.
  - The purpose of this will be to expose local devices available in a node via the `LocalVolumeDiscoveryResult` CR.
  - The device discovery will be continuous process so that newly added and removed devices can be detected.
- Auto provisioning of localDevices
  - This will introduce a new CR called `LocalVolumeSet`.
  - The purpose of this will be to auto discover and provision PVs on devices which match the inclusion filter present in the CR.
  - This will involve a continous process of discovery of devices via the diskmaker daemons. Any discovered devices which matches the inclusion filter will be considered for provisioning of PVs.

Once we have the detected devices the administrator can create the localPVs by explicitly selecting the disks. This can be done by the `localVolume` CR. The other option would be to create localPVs via the `LocalVolumeSet` CR and passing the inclusion filters in it.

### Workflow of LocalPV creation via LocalVolume CR

1. Discovery: The user can choose to run discovery if they want to understand what devices are available across the nodes in the cluster.
    - NOTE: This step is optional for users directly creating CRs. They might already know what CRs they need for step 2.
2. PV Creation: After the user has decided how to create PVs, they can choose to create PVs with either the `LocalVolume` CR or the `LocalVolumeSet` CR.

## Design Details for `Auto discovery of local devices`

API scheme for `LocalVolumeDiscovery` CR:

```go
// DiscoveryPhase defines the observed phase of the discovery process
type DiscoveryPhase string

// Different phases of the discovery process

}

type LocalVolumeDiscovery struct {
  metav1.TypeMeta   `json:",inline"`
  metav1.ObjectMeta `json:"metadata"`
  Spec              LocalVolumeDiscoverySpec   `json:"spec"`
  Status            LocalVolumeDiscoveryStatus `json:"status,omitempty"`

type LocalVolumeDiscoveryList struct {
  metav1.TypeMeta `json:",inline"`
  metav1.ListMeta `json:"metadata"`
  Items           []LocalVolumeDiscovery `json:"items"`

```

```go


// DeviceState defines the observed state of the disk
type DeviceState string

const (
  // Available means that the device is available to use and a new persistent volume can be provisioned on it
  Available DeviceState = "Available"
  // NotAvailable means that the device is already used by some other process and shouldn't be used to provision a Persistent Volume
  NotAvailable DeviceState = "NotAvailable"
  // Unknown means that the state of the device can't be determined
  Unknown DeviceState = "Unknown"
)

// DeviceStatus defines the observed state of the discovered devices
type DeviceStatus struct{
  // State shows the availability of the device
  State DeviceState `json:"state"`

### Workflow of `Auto Device Discovery`
The discovery of local devices will be done by the `LocalVolumeDiscovery` and `LocalVolumeDiscoveryResult` CR.

#### LocalVolumeDiscovery Controller
- Once the `LocalVolumeDiscovery` CR is deployed, its controller will:
  - Create a daemonSet to run on each of the valid nodes.(Information about the valid list of nodes would be available in the `LocalVolumeDiscovery` CR as `nodeSelector`)
  - The `Daemonset` should have `LocalVolumeDiscovery` CR as owner reference.
  - Update the `Phase` in the `LocalVolumeDiscovery` CR to `Discovering`.
- The DaemonSet pod running on each valid node will:
  - Identify the list of devices available on that node.
  - Create `LocalVolumeDiscoveryResult` CR for the node with `DiscoveredDevices` and `discoveredTimeStamp` information.
  - Start continuous discovery of disks:
    - Discovery of devices should be started again in following scenarios:
      - `add` and `remove` `udev` events on the block devices.
      - After a fixed interval of time. (say 60 minutes).
    - If the newly discovered devices are different from the previously `DiscoveredDevices` then:
      - Update the `DiscoveredDevices` `status` of the `LocalVolumeDiscoveryResult` CR with the list of newly identified devices.
      - Update the `discoveredTimeStamp` `status` of the `LocalVolumeDiscoveryResult` with current timestamp
`
#### Device properties to be discovered
- `LocalVolumeDiscovery` should discover following details about the device:
  - `DeviceID`: Persistent name of the device. For eg, /dev/disk/by-id/...
  - `Path`: Device path. For eg, /dev/sdb
  - `Model`: Detected device model.
  - `Type`: Detected device type. For eg, disk, partition, etc.
  - `Vendor`: Detected device vendor.
  - `Property`: Holds the device's mechanical spec. It can be rotational or nonRotational
  - `FSType`: Filesystem available on the device, if any.
  - `Status`: Status of the device. This object includes:
    - `State`: The current state of the device
      - `Available`: Available means that the device is available to use and a new persistent volume can be provisioned on it
      - `NotAvailable`: NotAvailable means that the device is already used by some other process and can't be used to provision a Persistent Volume
      - `Unknown`: Unknown means that the state of the device can't be determined

#### `Auto Device Discovery` Status
- Consumers of Local Storage Operator can track the status of the `Auto Device Discovery` by directly tracking the `LocalVolumeDiscoveryResult` CR.
- `LocalVolumeDiscovery` `phase` can only be either `Discovering` or `DiscoveryFailed` at a given time.
- As the discovery starts, Controller should update the `LocalVolumeDiscovery` `Phase` as `Discovering`, indicating a continous discovery process.
- Controller should update the `LocalVolumeDiscovery` `Phase` as `DiscoveryFailed` if:
  - There is some error in running the `DaemonSet`

#### `Auto Device Discovery` Cadence
- Auto discovery of devices should be a continuous proccess to support on-going management of devices and to display the devices in an inventory list.
- Auto discovery should continuously check for the list of available devices on a given node to identify if a new device has been added or an existing device has been removed.
- In case of any addition or deletion of devices, the `LocalVolumeDiscoveryResult` CR should be updated to reflect the new set of devices on the node.
- Continuous discovery can be triggered based following criteria:
  - After every fixed interval of time.
  - After any `udev` events on the block device (like `add` or `remove`)

#### `Auto Device Discovery` Node Deletion
- User updates the `LocalVolumeDiscovery` CR to remove node(s) for discovery:
  - Controller would update the Daemonset with the new set of nodes.
  - This would automatically delete the daemonset pod running on the removed node(s).
  - `LocalVolumeDiscoveryResult` CR for the removed node would be still available, but no continous discovery will be happening. User can manually delete these CR if disk information is not required anymore.

#### `Auto Device Discovery` Node Addition
- User updates the `LocalVolumeDiscovery` CR to track new node(s) for discovery:
  - Controller would update the Daemonset with the new set of nodes.
  - This would automatically create a daemonset pod and start discovery on the newly added node(s).

#### `Auto Device Discovery` CR Deletion
- A delete request on the `LocalVolumeDiscovery` CR would:
  - Delete the `daemonset` automatically as it has the owner reference of the `LocalVolumeDiscovery` CR
  - `LocalVolumeDiscoveryResult` CR for each node would be still available, but no continous discovery will be happening. User can manually delete these CR if the existing disk information is not required anymore.

#### Multiple `Auto Device Discovery` CR
- Controller should not support multiple `LocalVolumeDiscovery` CR by enforcing the CR name in the Custom Resource Definition


Example of `LocalVolumeDiscovery` CR:
```yaml
apiVersion: local.storage.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: LocalVolumeDiscovery
metadata:
  name: example-autodetect
  namespace: localStorage
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
          - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
            operator: In
            values:
              - worker-0
              - worker-1
status:
  phase: Discovering
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2020-03-17T09:33:43Z"
    status: "True"
    type: Available
```

#### LocalVolumeDiscoveryResult CR
- The `LocalVolumeDiscoveryResult` CR will be exposing the available local devices of the node in its status.
- These information will mostly be the output of  `lsblk -o name,model,vendor,kname,pkname,fstype,type,uuid,tran,ro,rm,parttype,serial,size,rota,mountpoint`.

Example of `LocalVolumeDiscoveryResult` CR after detection:
```yaml
apiVersion: local.storage.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: LocalVolumeDiscoveryResult
metadata:
  name: discovery-result-<hashed-node-name>
  namespace: localStorage
  labels:
  - local.storage.openshift.io/discovery-node: <node-name>
spec:
  nodeName: worker-0
status:
  discoveredTimeStamp: '2020-03-09T08:37:19Z'
  discoveredDevices:
    - path: /dev/sda
      deviceID: /dev/disk/by-id/<device-id>
      model: SAMSUNG MZ7LN512
      vendor: ATA
      type: disk
      size: 477G
      property: Rotational
      fstype: ext4
      status:
        state: Available

### Workflow of `LocalPV` creation via `LocalVolumeSet CR`
- Once the `LocalVolumeSet` is created, the controller will:
  - configure the local-static-provisioner to make a new StorageClass based on certain directories on the selected nodes.
  - assign diskmaker daemonset to the selected nodes.
  - there will be one daemonset for each `LocalVolumeSet` CR.
- The diskmaker daemon will find devices that match the disovery policy and symlink them into the directory that the local-static-provisioner is watching.

#### Note: There is a chance of race condition and duplicate creation of PVs
- If two `LocalVolumeSet` CR targets same nodes with overlapping inclusion filter.
- If `LocalVolumeSet` CR and `LocalVolume` CR targets the same node with overlapping devices.

Example of `LocalVolumeSet` CR:

```yaml

```

### Test Plan

- The integration tests for the LSO already exist. These tests will need to be updated to test this feature.
- The tests must ensure that detection of devices are working/updating correctly.
- The tests must ensure that data corruption are not happening during auto detection of devices.

### Graduation Criteria

- Documentation exists for the behaviour of each configuration item.
- Unit and End to End tests coverage is sufficient.

#### Removing a deprecated feature

- None of the features are getting deprecated

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

Since this requires a new implementation no new upgrade strategy will be required.

### Version Skew Strategy

N/A

## Implementation History

N/A

## Drawbacks

N/A

## Alternatives

- Existing manual creation of LocalVolume CRs. With the node selector on the LocalVolume, a single CR can apply to an entire class of nodes (i.e., a machineset or a physical rack of homogeneous hardware). When a machineset is defined, a corresponding LocalVolume can also be created.
- Directly enhancing the LocalVolume CR to allow for auto discovery

The first approach requires some manual work and knowledge of underlying nodes, this makes it inefficient for large clusters. The second approach can introduce breaking change to the existing GA API. Therefore this approach makes sense.
