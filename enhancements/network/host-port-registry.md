# Host Port Registry

OpenShift has a number of host-level services that listen on a socket. Since they
are not isolated by network namespace, they can conflict if both listen on the same
port.

This document serves as the authoritative list of port assignments.

## Background

Ports 9000-9999 are available for general use by system services. We require that
customers open this range [and several others](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/blob/master/modules/installation-network-user-infra.adoc)
between nodes.

The user-facing documentation, informed by the installer's
terraform templates, is the authoritative source for usable port ranges.

These ports are used by certain services that, for whatever reason, must run
in the host network (or use host-port forwarding).

The Kubernetes scheduler is aware of host ports, and will fail to schedule pods
on a node where there would be a port conflict.

### Localhost

Separately, it is a common pattern for a pod to have one or more processes only
listening on localhost. Since all HostNetwork pods share a network namespace,
coordination is also required in this case.

## Requirements

All processes that wish to listen on a host port MUST

- Have an entry in the table below
- be in a [documented range](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/blob/master/modules/installation-network-user-infra.adoc), 
  if they are intended to be reachable 
- declare that port in their `Pod.Spec`

Localhost-only ports SHOULD be outside of this range, to leave room.

## External

Ports are assumed to be used on all nodes in all clusters unless otherwise specified.

## Previously allocated

If a feature is completely removed, (not just deprecated), then any now-free
ports should be noted here, along with the version in which they were removed.


## Future 

We can enforce this in an automated fashion in the future. We should write tests
that ensure

- pods opening host ports declare those ports in their Pod.Spec (host-level processes excluded)
- pods that declare host ports are in the port registry. The registry will need to be machine-readable
