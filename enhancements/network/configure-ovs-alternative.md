# Configure-ovs Alternative

## Summary

There are some significant limitations to the existing configure-ovs.sh design
in OVNKubernetes. This enhancement is an alternative method of configuring the
br-ex bridge needed by OVNK using NMState that will address most, if not all,
of the problems with the existing implementation.

## Motivation

There are a few problems with configure-ovs.sh:

* It is implemented in Bash, which makes it fragile and difficult to test.
* It is guessing at what the deployer wants for their bridge configuration,
  and it is awkward to override when it guesses wrong.
* It has customer-specific logic because there is no alternative for us to
  support advanced use cases.
* It is incompatible with day 2 changes to the bridge using things like the
  Kubernetes-NMState operator because the operator and script configurations
  will overwrite each other.

### User Stories

* As an OpenShift administrator, I want the OVNKubernetes bridge on a different
  interface from the node IP.

* As an OpenShift administrator, I want to be able to make changes to the
  bridge interface using the same tools I do on the other interfaces.

* As an OpenShift developer, I want a mechanism for bridge configuration that
  is well-tested and less likely to break than a Bash script.

* As an OpenShift developer, I want to avoid further complications in the
  configure-ovs.sh script by providing a better way to do advanced bridge
  configuration.

### Goals

Once this design is implemented, deployers of OpenShift will be able to
explicitly configure br-ex to their exact specifications and will be able to
modify it after deployment using standard networking tools.

### Non-Goals

Complete replacement of configure-ovs. This mechanism is intended for more
advanced use cases, but it will require more complex configuration than
basic deployments need. A possible followup would be to reimplement
configure-ovs.sh in terms of this new mechanism so there is a simple path
here too, but that is not required for the initial implementation.

An example of a use case this is not intended to address would be a
single-nic deployment on a cloud platform with no unusual network settings.
In that case manual configuration of br-ex would be an unnecessary extra
burden on the user and the logic to handle it automatically would be fairly
simple so using configure-ovs is far less likely to cause problems.

However, it should be noted that this initial implementation does not preclude
future work to replace configure-ovs in all cases. The nmpolicy feature of
NMState may be able to provide a sufficiently generic configuration that no
user input would be required. This can be investigated as a followup once
we have a solution for the more complex use cases.

## Proposal

This mechanism will be similar to the day-1 network configuration described
in enhancements/network/baremetal-ipi-network-configuration.md. However,
there will be some important differences, which will be discussed below.

At a high level, we will provide an interface for the deployer to specify
per-host interface configuration. Configuration for an OpenVSwitch bridge
named br-ex will be mandatory. The format for the configuration will be
NMState YAML, which will be provided to each node via Ignition. Around the
same point in the boot process that configure-ovs would run, we will run
NMState to apply the provided configuration. This will only be done on first
boot because subsequent changes will be made using the Kubernetes-NMState
operator. When this mechanism is used to create br-ex, the configure-ovs
script will be skipped to avoid conflicts.

### Important differences from baremetal day-1

Instead of pre-processing the NMState config into NetworkManager
nmconnection files, we will simply write the NMState file directly to
the host disk. As of 4.14 we have NMState available at the host level
so it will no longer be necessary to run NMState in a container.

Since this is intended to be a replacement for configure-ovs, it must
work in a cross-platform manner. The baremetal feature is implemented in the
baremetal-operator, which means non-baremetal platforms cannot use it.

However, this is not a replacement for the baremetal feature (and any other
platform-specific deploy-time network configuration tools). This is because
minimal networking is required in order to pull Ignition, and since this new
configuration will be provided through Ignition it will still be necessary
to have platform-specific methods of injecting network config before Ignition
runs. However, the platform-specific part can be much simpler because it
won't need to handle every possible network configuration, just enough to
reach the Ignition endpoint. In some use cases, platform-specific configuration
won't even be needed.

### Workflow Description

During initial deployment, the user will provide the installer with a
machine-config manifest containing base64-encoded NMState YAML for each node
in the cluster. This manifest may look something like:

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig

    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker

        mode: 0644
        overwrite: true
        path: /etc/nmstate/openshift/worker-1.yaml
```

The filenames must correspond to the hostname of each node as that will be
used to map the configuration to the node. A separate manifest will need
to be provided for masters and workers, which is typical when working with
machine-configs.

When the new service runs, it will copy the appropriate YAML file (based on
the hostname of the node) to /etc/nmstate so it will be applied by the normal
system NMState service. If there is already a file in /etc/nmstate with the
same name, the service will fail in order to avoid overwriting important
system configuration. When this mechanism is used to provide host network
configuration, other NMState files deployed by (for example) MCO should not
be used. All necessary network configuration should be in the single file
provided via this new feature.

Alternatively, there will be a mechanism to deploy a single cluster-wide
configuration. That might look like:

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: master
  name: 10-br-ex-master
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.2.0
    storage:
      files:
      - contents:
          source: data:text/plain;charset=utf-8;base64,aW50ZXJmYWNlczoKLSBuYW1lOiBlbnAyczAKICB0eXBlOiBldGhlcm5ldAogIHN0YXRlOiB1cAogIGlwdjQ6CiAgICBlbmFibGVkOiBmYWxzZQogIGlwdjY6CiAgICBlbmFibGVkOiBmYWxzZQotIG5hbWU6IGJyLWV4CiAgdHlwZTogb3ZzLWJyaWRnZQogIHN0YXRlOiB1cAogIGNvcHktbWFjLWZyb206IGVucDJzMAogIGlwdjQ6CiAgICBlbmFibGVkOiBmYWxzZQogICAgZGhjcDogZmFsc2UKICBpcHY2OgogICAgZW5hYmxlZDogZmFsc2UKICAgIGRoY3A6IGZhbHNlCiAgYnJpZGdlOgogICAgcG9ydDoKICAgIC0gbmFtZTogZW5wMnMwCiAgICAtIG5hbWU6IGJyLWV4Ci0gbmFtZTogYnItZXgKICB0eXBlOiBvdnMtaW50ZXJmYWNlCiAgc3RhdGU6IHVwCiAgaXB2NDoKICAgIGVuYWJsZWQ6IHRydWUKICAgIGRoY3A6IHRydWUKICBpcHY2OgogICAgZW5hYmxlZDogZmFsc2UKICAgIGRoY3A6IGZhbHNl
        mode: 0644
        overwrite: true
        path: /etc/nmstate/openshift/cluster.yaml
```

The only difference is there will be a single file applied to each node of the
specified role. The name of the file must be `cluster.yaml`.
If there are both node-specific and cluster-wide configuration
files present, the node-specific one will take precedence. Again, separate
manifests will be needed for each role because of how MCO works.

When this mechanism is in use, a flag will be set to indicate to configure-ovs
that it should not attempt to configure br-ex.

Day 2 changes will be handled by Kubernetes-NMState. For the initial
implementation, a limited set of changes will be supported. This is because
some operations will be disruptive and we don't currently have any way to
orchestrate such a change. To begin, we intend to support the following day 2
changes:

- DNS updates
- MTU updates
- Add more subordinate interfaces (such as VLANs) to the interface underlying br-ex
  - Currently known to be blocked by https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-14107
    but a fix is in progress.
- Change bond miimon, mode, and QoS configuration
  - This has been tested and is already working with configure-ovs, so in
    theory it should require little to no effort in this new model.
- Rollback of any failed changes
  - There are known issues with this that may require changes on the OVNK side.

Details on writing NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicies for each of these cases
will be provided in the product documentation.

#### Scaleout

When scaling out new nodes on day 2, it will be necessary to update the
appropriate machine-configs with NMState YAML for the new node(s). If a
cluster-wide configuration is in use, no changes will be necessary. This
must happen before the scaleout occurs.

Since we don't want to trigger a reboot of the entire cluster before each
scaleout operation, we will add the NMState configuration directory to the
list of paths for which the machine-config-operator will not trigger a reboot.
Files in this path will only be applied on initial deployment anyway so it
will never be necessary to reboot a node when updates are made. Note that,
as mentioned above, if changes are desired on day 2 they should be made
with Kubernetes-NMState, not by updating the machine-configs used here.

#### Migration

An existing cluster using configure-ovs to manage br-ex can be migrated to
this new mechanism. In order to do so, the user will take the following
actions:

- Create machine-configs in the same manner as those passed to the installer
  for initial deployment.
- Trigger a rolling reboot of the cluster to apply those new configurations.
  Since the machine-configs for this feature explicitly do not cause a reboot,
  this could be done by applying a trivial separate machine-config. At some
  point in the future, we expect MCO to implement a new feature that will
  allow an administrator to specify the reboot behavior of the machine-config,
  which will eliminate the need for this step.
  More details on this can be found in the enhancement:
  https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1525

#### Variation [optional]

We have settled on an approach and are not currently pursuing other options.

### API Extensions

This will not directly modify the API of OpenShift. The API for this feature is
implemented in Kubernetes-NMState, and this does not require any specific
modifications in that project at this time.

### Topology Considerations
#### Hypershift / Hosted Control Planes

This should not have any hypershift-specific considerations.

#### Standalone Clusters

Initially, this feature will target just baremetal clusters. Once we are
confident that the design is working as intended in what are usually the most
complex networking environments for OpenShift, we will extend support to all
platforms.

#### Single-node Deployments or MicroShift

This does not introduce any new runtime components so should not affect
resource consumption in SNO and MicroShift deployments.

### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints [optional]

Scaleout in this implementation (using static IPs on baremetal to demonstrate
as many parts of the process as possible) would look something like this:

* Add the new node's configuration to the machine-config for its role.
  * `oc edit mc 10-br-ex-worker`
* Create and apply a secret containing the minimal static IP configuration
  needed for the node to pull ignition.
  * `oc apply -f ./extraworker-secret.yaml`
* Create and apply a BareMetalHost resource with the network secret attached
  via the `preprovisioningNetworkDataName` field.
```yaml
apiVersion: metal3.io/v1alpha1
kind: BareMetalHost
spec:
  # ...
  preprovisioningNetworkDataName: ostest-extraworker-0-network-config-secret
```
* Scale out the machineset to deploy the new node.
  * `oc project openshift-machine-api`
    `oc get machinesets`
    `oc scale machineset [name of machineset] --replicas=[number of nodes desired after scaling]`

The node will initially boot with the network configuration specified in
`preprovisioningNetworkDataName` and then have the configuration in the
machine-config applied.

Only the first step of the process is new for this feature. The rest is
standard baremetal scaleout when using static IPs.

### Risks and Mitigations

Because this gives the deployer a great deal of control over the bridge
configuration for OVNK, they will have the ability to configure it incorrectly,
which may cause problems either on initial deployment or at any point after.
We will want to ensure that must-gather is collecting enough information about
the bridge configuration for us to determine whether it is compliant with our
guidelines, and we must have clear instructions on what is required for br-ex.

Note, however, that if an incorrect bridge configuration is applied NMState
will usually catch that and roll back the changes.

### Drawbacks

OpenShift has historically avoided per-host configuration for cluster nodes.
This is a large departure from that philosophy, but that is unavoidable.
Certain aspects of networking (notably static IPs) are by nature host-specific
and cannot be handled any other way.

Using a machine-config to do initial deployment and a
NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy to make day 2 changes will require a manual sync
of the NMState configuration. Unfortunately this is unavoidable because the
Kubernetes-NMState operator is not part of the core payload so it (and its
CRDs) cannot be used for initial deployment. A possible future improvement
in this area would be to have Kubernetes-NMState "adopt" the configuration
applied by this process and generate an NNCP automatically when it is
installed.


## Open Questions [optional]

* There has been resistance to using the NMState API in OpenShift in the past
  because it is not compliant with the OpenShift API Guidelines. There is work
  underway in NMState to address this, but is that mandatory for this to be
  implemented?

  Previous discussions:
  https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1267#discussion_r1013320148

  Some initial work to address this concern:
  https://github.com/nmstate/nmstate/pull/2338

* If changes are made to the bridge configuration on day 2, will OVNKubernetes
  handle those correctly without a reboot? If not, how do we orchestrate a
  reboot?

  Reply from @cgoncalves:
  > OVN-Kubernetes will not handle the replacement of the gateway interface (e.g. enp2s0). This is an existing limitation where OVN-Kubernetes installs an OpenFlow rule in br-ex that states the gateway interface is the OVS port ID of enp2s0 (port 1) and where attaching a new interface, say enp3s0, its OVS port ID will be different hence no egress traffic forwarding.

  That doesn't have to block this feature being implemented, but it's something
  we should look into as a followup with the OVNK team.

* Do all platforms have a concept of individual hosts? I know baremetal does and
  I believe VSphere as well, but I'm not sure about cloud platforms.

* Depending on the answer to the previous question, can we require such platforms
  to use only the cluster-wide configuration? I think this should be fine since
  those platforms tend not to use things like static IPs that may require per-host
  configuration.

## Test Plan

We will want to add this feature to one of the baremetal e2e jobs.

## Graduation Criteria

### Dev Preview -> Tech Preview

We do not plan on a Dev Preview phase for this feature.

### Tech Preview -> GA

Our primary concern for GA at this time is error-handling. In particular,
there is a known bug with rollback that has significant impacts on this
feature. If we are able to get that fixed by 4.16 GA this will be shipped
as GA. Otherwise it will remain tech preview.

The bug tracking this can be found here: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-31972

### Removing a deprecated feature

NA

## Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

Only relevant for Kubernetes-NMState and will be handled the same way it is
today.

## Version Skew Strategy

Only relevant for Kubernetes-NMState and will be handled the same way it is
today.

## Operational Aspects of API Extensions

NA

## Support Procedures

If there is a problem with the provided network configuration, NMState will
fail to apply it and the deployment will fail because br-ex will not be
present. However, because the node is required to have functional networking
prior to this config being applied, NetworkManager should roll back any bad
changes, leaving the node accessible via its original network config.

On day 2, Kubernetes-NMState has health probes that are run to verify every
config applied. If there is a problem, the config will be rolled back and the
NNCP will be set to an error state. At worst this should result in a temporary
outage on a single node.

## Alternatives

Continue adding features and customizability to configure-ovs. This has not
proven to be an effective strategy up to now, but it is an option.

## Infrastructure Needed [optional]

Nothing new, this will build on existing infrastructure.
