# CVO Log Level API

## Summary

This enhancement proposes to create and modify OpenShift APIs to provide a simple
method of dynamically changing the verbosity level of Cluster Version Operator's
logs. There will be four log levels available. The lowest level being the
current default log level being used by the Cluster Version Operator.

## Motivation

There is currently no way to easily change the verbosity of the [Cluster Version Operator (CVO)](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-version-operator)
logs in a live cluster.

It would be useful to provide functionality for the cluster administrators and
OpenShift engineers to easily modify the log level to a desired level using an API
[similarly as can be done for some other operators](https://github.com/openshift/api/blob/5852b58f4b1071fe85d9c49dff2667a9b2a74841/operator/v1/types.go#L67-L74).

### User Stories

* As an OpenShift administrator, I want to increase the log level of the CVO 
  from the default level to more easily troubleshoot any potential issues regarding
  the cluster or the CVO.
* As an OpenShift administrator, I want to decrease the log level of the CVO
  from a previously set higher log level to save storage space.
* As an OpenShift engineer, I want to increase the log level of the CVO for
  a CI run so that I can more easily troubleshoot any potential issues.

### Goals

* Add a user-facing API for controlling the verbosity of the CVO logs.

### Non-Goals

* Change the default logging verbosity of the Cluster Version Operator.
* Allow users to set a lower than the current default logging level.

## Proposal

This enhancement proposes to create a new `CustomResourceDefinition` (CRD) 
called `clusterversionoperators.operator.openshift.io`. The new type will be part 
of the [`github.com/openshift/api/operator/v1alpha1`][github.com/openshift/api/operator/v1alpha1]
package. A `ClusterVersionOperator` resource will be used to configure the 
CVO. The configuration, as of now, will only contain the knob to modify the CVO 
log level. A `ClusterVersionOperator` resource named `cluster` will be added to
the OCP payload. This resource will act as a singleton configuration resource
for the CVO. The CVO will dynamically change the verbosity of its logs based on a
value provided in the new resource. The CRD is described in more detail in the
**Implementation Details** section. A new CRD is created to better differentiate 
between the cluster version and the CVO configuration.

Four log levels will be available. The lowest level being the
current default log level being used by the Cluster Version Operator. The exact 
log levels are defined as per the existing [`LogLevel`][LogLevelType] enum.

[LogLevelType]: https://github.com/openshift/api/blob/f89ab92f1597eaed4de5b947c1781adde2bf42fb/operator/v1/types.go#L94-L110

### Workflow Description

Given a cluster administrator and a working standalone cluster for which the 
administrator is responsible.

**Cluster administrator** is a human user responsible for managing the cluster.

1. The cluster administrator notices an issue in the cluster and chooses to
   troubleshoot the issue.
2. The cluster administrator, after some troubleshooting, notices that the logs
   of the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) might help.
3. The cluster administrator notices that the logs are not detailed enough to
   troubleshoot the issue.
4. The cluster administrator raises the log level from the default value to a
   more verbose level by simply modifying the new `ClusterVersionOperator`
   resource named `cluster` via the web console or by patching the resource by
   using the CLI.
5. The cluster administrator fixes the issue in the cluster.
6. The cluster administrator notices that the CVO outputs too many logs for the
   administrator's liking.
7. The cluster administrator lowers the log level of the CVO to the lowest 
   level, the default level.
8. The cluster administrator is now a happy cluster administrator.

### API Extensions

The enhancement proposes to create a new `ClusterVersionOperator` CRD. A new
`ClusterVersionOperator` resource will only impact the CVO logging level.

In HyperShift, its API and logic will be slightly extended.

### Topology Considerations

#### Hypershift / Hosted Control Planes

A hosted CVO is located in the management cluster and accesses the hosted API
server. Applying the configuration in the hosted cluster would enable a hosted
cluster administrator to modify a workload running in the management cluster.
A hosted cluster administrator could set the log level of the hosted CVO in the
management cluster, thus affecting the storage space of the management cluster.

Thus, the new CRD and the CR will not be applied in a hosted cluster. This 
will be achieved using the [cluster profiles][cluster-profiles]. The new CRD 
and CR will be missing the `include.release.openshift.io/hypershift: "true"` 
annotation, and thus they won't be applied in a hosted cluster.

In HyperShift, the `HostedCluster` API will be extended to include a CVO 
configuration. This configuration will be then transferred to a 
configuration file that will be accessible to the hosted CVO. Meaning that 
the HyperShift will generate a configuration file for the hosted CVO based 
on the set HyperShift API values. The hosted CVO, when configured to use a 
configuration file, will not try to reconcile a configuration CR using the API 
server.

This way no CRDs will be created in the management cluster, a problem since 
a management cluster may host multiple OCP clusters of different versions. No 
configuration API will be introduced in the hosted cluster that would have to be
otherwise protected by a validating admission policy.

The configuration file will be a manifest file of a `ClusterVersionOperator` 
object. The CVO will simply load the file and inspect its fields. Simplifying 
the structure of the configuration file. In a potential case that the 
configuration for a hosted CVO will become different from a 
configuration to a standalone CVO, the hosted CVO will be taught to 
differentiate between different versions of configuration files. 

The API changes are described in more detail in the **Implementation
Details** section.

#### Standalone Clusters

In standalone clusters, cluster administrators will be able to specify the desired
CVO log level. No additional changes are needed.

#### Single-node Deployments or MicroShift

Same as standalone clusters.

### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints

This enhancement proposes to create a new `operator/v1alpha1/types_clusterversion.go` 
file in the [OpenShift API repository](https://github.com/openshift/api). 
Meaning the new data types will be part of the [`github.com/openshift/api/operator/v1alpha1`][github.com/openshift/api/operator/v1alpha1]
package. A new feature-gated cluster scoped alpha configuration API resource 
will be defined to configure the CVO.

The types are inspired by the existing [`OperatorSpec`][OperatorSpec]
and [`OperatorStatus`][OperatorStatus]
structures and copy over some of the fields. Only the  
`OperatorLogLevel` field is introduced to the `spec` field as there is currently
no need to support the rest of the [`OperatorSpec`][OperatorSpec]
fields or any new fields. A similar case applies to the 
[`OperatorStatus`][OperatorStatus] fields. The `ObservedGeneration` field is 
used to give feedback regarding the last generation change the CVO has dealt
with. There is currently no need to support additional fields.

The `ClusterVersionOperator` CRD will be behind a new 
`ClusterVersionOperatorConfiguration` FeatureGate that will be used to 
control the development of the CVO configuration.

A `ClusterVersionOperator` resource named `cluster` will be added to
the OCP payload. This resource will act as a singleton configuration resource
for the CVO. Thus, validation using the CEL will be introduced to ensure only 
the `ClusterVersionOperator` resource named `cluster` exists. The 
[`release.openshift.io/create-only`][create-only] annotation will be used to 
ensure that the CVO will only create the resource as part of reconciling the 
payload and will not overwrite any user changes.

```

#### HyperShift

This section discusses the needed API changes for HyperShift.

The existing [`ClusterConfiguration`][ClusterConfigurationAPI] API could be
considered to host the hosted CVO configuration API; however, its purpose is 
oriented around the configuration API (`github.com/openshift/api/config/v1`),
meaning configuration for OCP components rather than just operators. As such, 
a new API is proposed to extend the [`HostedCluster`][HostedClusterAPI] API. A new
`OperatorConfiguration` API where various APIs similar to ones from the
`github.com/openshift/api/operator/v1` package can be referenced, including a 
hosted CVO configuration API. The new changes will be behind the
`ClusterVersionOperatorConfiguration` feature gate as well.
The following changes are proposed for the [HyperShift API][api/hypershift].

[HostedClusterAPI]: https://hypershift-docs.netlify.app/reference/api/#hypershift.openshift.io/v1beta1.HostedCluster
[ClusterConfigurationAPI]: https://github.com/openshift/hypershift/blob/a0191dbda4ac75bd8ee19869d9a952aa508b3f2b/api/hypershift/v1beta1/hostedcluster_types.go#L2868
[api/hypershift]: https://github.com/openshift/hypershift/blob/main/api/hypershift/
[cluster-profiles]: https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/update/cluster-profiles.md

A new type for the hosted CVO configuration. This will enable us to expose 
only the configuration applicable for HyperShift. The type for the hosted CVO 
configuration:

```go
// ClusterVersionOperatorSpec is the specification of the desired behavior of the Cluster Version Operator.
type ClusterVersionOperatorSpec struct {
	// operatorLogLevel is an intent based logging for the operator itself.  It does not give fine grained control, but it is a
	// simple way to manage coarse grained logging choices that operators have to interpret for themselves.
	//
	// Valid values are: "Normal", "Debug", "Trace", "TraceAll".
	// Defaults to "Normal".
	// +optional
	// +kubebuilder:default=Normal
	OperatorLogLevel operatorv1.LogLevel `json:"operatorLogLevel,omitempty"`
}
```

The type will be included in a new type that will host various configurations 
for operators:

```go
// OperatorConfiguration specifies configuration for individual OCP operators in the
// cluster, represented as embedded resources that correspond to the openshift
// operator API.
type OperatorConfiguration struct {
	// ClusterVersionOperator specifies the configuration for the Cluster Version Operator in the hosted cluster.
	//
	// +optional
	ClusterVersionOperator ClusterVersionOperatorSpec `json:"clusterVersionOperator,omitempty"`
}
```

The `OperatorConfiguration` type itself will be included in the 
`HostedClusterSpec` and `HostedControlPlaneSpec` types. Its values will be 
propagated from the `HostedClusterSpec` field to the `HostedControlPlaneSpec` 
field in a live cluster. An example of the modification to the
`HostedClusterSpec` type:

```go
type HostedClusterSpec struct {
        ...
	// OperatorConfiguration specifies configuration for individual OCP operators in the
	// cluster, represented as embedded resources that correspond to the openshift
	// operator API.
	//
	// +optional
	// +openshift:enable:FeatureGate=ClusterVersionOperatorConfiguration
	OperatorConfiguration *OperatorConfiguration `json:"operatorConfiguration,omitempty"`
```

### Risks and Mitigations

No risks are known.

No important logs will be lost due to this enhancement. The lowest settable 
log level, the `Normal` level, will represent the current default CVO log level.

### Drawbacks

No drawbacks are known.

## Open Questions [optional]

No open questions.

## Test Plan

* Unit tests
* E2E test(s) to ensure that the CVO correctly reconciles the new resource

## Graduation Criteria

### Dev Preview -> Tech Preview

- Ability to utilize the enhancement end to end
- Relative API stability
- Sufficient test coverage
- Gather feedback

### Tech Preview -> GA

- Sufficient time for feedback
- All tests are implemented
- Available by default
- API is stable
- User-facing documentation created in [openshift-docs](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/)
- User-facing documentation created in the applicable HyperShift documentation

### Removing a deprecated feature

No existing feature will be deprecated or removed.

## Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

Not applicable.

## Version Skew Strategy

The relevant component for this enhancement is the CVO. During a version skew, 
the default log level will be used.

## Operational Aspects of API Extensions

This enhancement proposes to create a new `ClusterVersionOperator` CRD.
A new CR will operationally impact only the CVO. It may increase or
decrease its logs. Impacting the storage.

The enhancement also proposes to extend the HyperShift API. An applicable 
HyperShift component will generate the configuration file for the hosted CVO.

## Support Procedures

Not applicable.

## Alternatives (Not Implemented)

### The CVO state will be represented by the ClusterVersion resource

The CVO will be configurable by the existing `ClusterVersion` resource. The 
`spec` field of the `ClusterVersion` resource will grow CVO configuration.   

This alternative was not chosen due to it breaking the existing API consistency
to an extent. `ClusterVersion` will continue to configure the cluster 
version, and the new `ClusterVersionOperator` resource will configure the CVO.

### The ClusterVersionOperator CRD will be applied to the management cluster

As the hosted CVO is running in the management cluster, its configuration 
resource will also be applied to the management cluster. The CRD will be 
namespace scoped; one `HostedClusterVersionOperator` resource per one hosted 
control plane namespace. The HyperShift will not have to process the 
`ClusterVersionOperator` resource in the hosted cluster as there will be none. 
This will result in less logic for the HyperShift to overwrite any user 
changes, and the hosted CVO configuration will be maintained by the same API 
server that maintains the hosted CVO.

This alternative was not chosen, as it increases the overall complexity of the 
solution. The HyperShift would have to support multiple potentially
different versions of the CRD, as the HyperShift is able to handle multiple
versions of OCP clusters on the same management cluster. The hosted CVO would 
have to learn to process multiple API servers simultaneously and would be given 
additional network and API server access in the management cluster.

An alternative is to propagate the desired CVO configuration from the 
`HostedCluster` API to the hosted CVO file system as currently being proposed.

### Do not introduce an option to dynamically modify the verbosity level of logs

The option for cluster administrators to choose the desired verbosity level will
not be introduced. This alternative was not chosen as the potential benefit of
the proposed change greatly outweighs the implementation cost.

## Infrastructure Needed [optional]

No new infrastructure is needed.
