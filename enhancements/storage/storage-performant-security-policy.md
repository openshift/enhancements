- [ ] Test plan is defined
- [ ] Graduation criteria for dev preview, tech preview, GA
- [ ] User-facing documentation is created in [openshift-docs](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/)

## Summary

We want to allow Openshift admins to change `fsGroupChangePolicy` defaulting policies for certain namespaces so as pods in the given namespace can start faster.

We also want to allow Openshift admins to set `seLinuxChangePolicy` for certain namespaces, so as they can opt-out of potentially breaking changes being introduced via `SELinuxMount` feature upcoming in future k8s releases.

## Motivation

### Motivation for fsgroupchangepolicy defaulting

Currently it can take a long time for volume's permission to be changed to match pod's `fsGroup`. This is a well known problem
in Kubernetes and Openshift. See - https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6221251 for more details.

To solve this problem, we introduced `fsGroupChangePolicy` - https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/b5608aea94cfb54fea3a63e1d74235759d036c51/pkg/apis/core/types.go#L3977 , which
can be configured in a `PodSpec` and be set to `OnRootMismatch`, which instructs kubelet to stop recursively changing permissions of a volume, if top level directory permissions match as expected by kubelet.

This usually speeds up pod startup because kubelet does not have to recursively change permission of each file and directory in the volume. This mechanism relies on heuristic that gets applied when recursively changing permissions of a volume -  kubelet changes permissions of top level directory as a last step in the entire process, when it performs full recursive `chown` and `chmod` of the volume.

Having said that, `fsGroupChangePolicy` still defaults to `Always`, which means kubelet will always recursively change permissions. The reason for defaulting to `Always` is - mostly backward compatibility and if users bring in volumes that were used outside kubernetes. In these cases `OnRootMismatch` may not be a safe default.

But for most intent and purpose, it can be a reasonable default and hence this proposal allows admins to configure a namespace such that, all pods created in the namespace will default to `OnRootMismatch` policy if pod does not specify a policy of its own. If a pod specifies its own `fsGroupChangePolicy` that is still used as a default and will not be overridden.

### Motivation for seLinuxChangePolicy defaulting

https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1710 is bringing changes which can be breaking for certain pods which use different selinux contexts for same volume between different pods or same pod. Once `SELinuxMount` feature becomes generally available, whenever supported (i.e CSI driver supports it, which will be true for all CSI drivers OCP ships by default), volumes will be mounted with selinux mount options, rather than container-runtime recursively `chcon`ing the volume.

Applying SELinux label as a mount option by default will eliminate time spent by container-runtime in recursively changing selinux labels of a volume. We have determined this to be mostly safe by observing usage patterns and metrics collected during beta process. Having said that, we also are aware that certain workloads will be broken with this default. Workloads that use same volume in multiple pods or mount same volume in different containers with different selinux policies *may* break.

By allowing cluster-admins to set namespace default of `seLinuxChangePolicy` we want to give control over how these changes are applied to Openshift clusters, without explicitly  changing pods themselves.

### User Stories

N/A

### Goals

- Allow Openshift admins to configure per-namespace default of `fsGroupChangePolicy`.
- Allow Openshift admins to configure per-namespace default of `seLinuxChangePolicy`.

### Non-Goals

* Change Openshift default globally.

## Proposal

### Allow admins to opt-in to `fsGroupChangePolicy` via namespace label

We propose a label `storage.openshift.io/fsgroup-change-policy` if that is set to `OnRootMismatch` in a namespace, then Openshift's SCC hooks start defaulting all pods created in that namespace with `OnRootMismatch` `FSGroupChangePolicy`.

```go
func getPodFsGroupChangePolicy(ns *corev1.Namespace) *api.PodFSGroupChangePolicy {
    fsGroupPolicy, ok := ns.Labels[securityv1.FSGroupChangePolicy]
    if !ok {
        return nil
    }
    if fsGroupPolicy == "OnRootMismatch" {
        onRootMismatchPolicy := api.FSGroupChangeOnRootMismatch
        return &onRootMismatchPolicy
    }
    return nil
}
```

### Allow admins to opt-in to `seLinuxChangePolicy` via namespace label

Similar to mechanism proposed above,  we propose to use label `storage.openshift.io/selinux-change-policy` to define namespace wide `seLinuxChangePolicy` if none are specified in a pod.

### Setting of `fsGroupChangePolicy` and `seLinuxChangePolicy` during admission

We propose to add a new admission hook (which will be eventually replaced with MAP) which will trigger the defautling logic, similar to how SCC matching hooks are triggered.

### Eventual replacement with Mutating Admission policy

We want to replace admission plugin with Mutating Admission Policy once the feature becomes generally available. Once Mutating Admission Policy becomes GA, we propose to replace the admission hook with MAP on the lines of https://docs.google.com/document/d/13xa7imyvQzok3IJ66mheGqemQGhkNySl-He1h1iRuSM/edit?usp=sharing

This would serve similar purpose as admission hook we are carrying as go code. We will also install corresponding VAP to prevent invalid values of the label when implementing this via Mutating Admission Policy.

We expect the MAP and VAP to be static and installed by CVO.

### Proof of concept

We have already implemented a proof-of-concept https://github.com/openshift/kubernetes/pull/2311/files, which works and does the job. But this uses existing SCC admission hook.


### Workflow Description

Admins that want to set defaults of `fsGroupChangePolicy` and `seLinuxChangePolicy` will set `storage.openshift.io/fsgroup-change-policy` or `storage.openshift.io/selinux-change-policy`
labels in corresponding namespaces.

This will result in setting these fields in all pods in affected namespace if these fields are *not* already set.

### API Extensions

Adds following labels as API conventions for defaulting of security policies:

- `storage.openshift.io/fsgroup-change-policy`
- `storage.openshift.io/selinux-change-policy`

### Topology Considerations

#### Hypershift / Hosted Control Planes

The defaulting of `fsGroupChangePolicy` and `seLinuxChangePolicy` should work same on HCP clusters as standalone clusters, because this feature is entirely controlled by `kube-apiserver` admission hook. We will ensure that, the e2e metrics cover HCP clusters too.

#### Standalone Clusters

The defaulting of `fsGroupChangePolicy` and `seLinuxChangePolicy` should work same in standalone clusters, because this feature is entirely controlled by `kube-apiserver` admission hook. As such, it should not require any special considerations.


#### Single-node Deployments or MicroShift

The defaulting of `fsGroupChangePolicy` and `seLinuxChangePolicy` should work same in single-node clusters as other type of clusters, because this feature is entirely controlled by `kube-apiserver` admission hook. We will ensure that, the e2e metrics cover single-node clusters and microsift too.

### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints

We will implement the necessary admission hooks in - https://github.com/openshift/apiserver-library-go/tree/master/pkg ,
which will be feature-gated while in Tech Preview.

### Risks and Mitigations

This feature requires storage to be enabled for this to work. See Operational Aspect section for more details.

### Drawbacks

The admission hook implementation should be replaced by Mutating Admission Hook and hence it is kinda busy work while we wait for MAP implementation to go GA in upstream.

## Alternatives (Not Implemented)

None

## Open Questions [optional]

None

## Test Plan

We will add e2e tests that validate if labels are working as intended. These would be either part of CSO tests or `openshift/origin` tests.

## Graduation Criteria

The feature will be behind a feature-gate `StoragePerformantSecurityPolicy` during tech-preview.

### Dev Preview -> Tech Preview

N/A

### Tech Preview -> GA

During the initial development this feature will be behind a Openshift feature gate and will not be generally available. When we move this feature-gate to GA,
it should be as simple as removal of the Openshift feature-gate.

### Removing a deprecated feature

N/A

## Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

This should not have any impact on Upgrade and Downgrade strategy.

## Version Skew Strategy

Since this feature only applies to control-plane defautling, IMO we should be fine even older version of kubelets etc.

## Operational Aspects of API Extensions

There is obvious aspect of supporting forever a label on namespace as a API extension in Openshift. For most practical purposes
this should work fine.

When we remove the admission hook and switch to using MAP, CSO is the one that will install the MAP hook and hence storage *must* be
enabled for the feature to work.

## Support Procedures

If the admission hook is not working properly then the defaults specified by `storage.openshift.io/selinux-change-policy` and `storage.openshift.io/fsgroup-change-policy` will
not apply to pods created in particular namespace. We will have to look into `kube-apiserver` logs to find out what went wrong in that case.
