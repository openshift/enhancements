# Quick Starts

## Release Signoff Checklist

- [x] Enhancement is `implementable`
- [x] Design details are appropriately documented from clear requirements
- [ ] Graduation criteria for dev preview, tech preview, GA

## Summary

OpenShift's Serverless team has proposed an idea to create a "Quick Starts"
mechanism which introduces users to various ways of interacting with serverless
in the Console. Quick Starts should be a mechanism we can use to vastly improve
our customer's initial user experience on a empty cluster or with all various 
workflows:

The goal of this proposal is to define a lightweight mechanism for OpenShift's
Console component, to guide users thought various workflows, and help them
understand the steps neccesary to get the desired outcome:

* Install operator
* Deployment of showcase application
* Cluster settings
* Networking
* ...

For Quick Starts we need a mechanism for their creation and publishment.

## Motivation

Help users with their understanding the principles of their workflows by guiding them though the necessary steps.

### Goals

1. Provide a mechanism to display user guides for various workflows.
2. Make users understand what are the steps needed to achieve their goals.
3. Provide new CRD format for writing the Quick Starts.
4. Have a repository for the out-of-the-box Quick Starts, those that describe how to install an operator or go though standard workflow.

## Proposal

* Introduce CRD format that will be used for writing Quick Starts.
* Introduce default repository for Quick Starts.
  
### User Stories

#### Story 1

As an administrator of an OpenShift cluster, I need a guide to walk me through how to install OpenShift Serverless modules (Serving and Eventing) in a cluster.

#### Story 2

As an administrator of an OpenShift cluster, I need a guide to walk me through how to update an OpenShift cluster.

#### Story 3

As a developer, I need a guide to walk me through how to deploy an existing application as a serverless workload.

#### Story 4

As a operator creator I want to provide operator consumers with a guide on how to install and user the my operator.

### Implementation Details

1. In order to provide mechanism to discribe a Quick Start, new CRD named `QuickStarts` will be created.
2. A new `openshift/quick-starts` repository will be created which will contain all supported Quick Starts. The `openshift/quick-starts` repository will have `release-*` branches.
3. `console-operator` will import all the existing Quick Starts CRs from appropriate branch of the `openshift/quick-starts` repository into the `/manifest` directory, so that the CVO can:
   * create them if the CR doesn't exists.
   * update the CRs upon the cluster update (since CVO is doing `apply`).
4. Steps in the Quick Starts will support basic markdown thats already in use in the OpenShift's Console.
5. All Quick Starts will be listed available in a separate page that will be accessible from Help Menu.

#### Quick Start icon

Each Quick Start CR can contain an icon that is specified in the `spec.icon` field. This field is a base64 encoded image that are used as Quick Start's icon.

#### Quick Start's Access Review

Since different users might not have access to specific actions on different resources, it would be pointless for them to go though a Quick Start and be unable to complete its tasks. For that reason the `spec` of the Quick Start CRD contains also `accessReviewResources` field, that should contain an array of resources and actions done on them, that user should perform during taking the Quick Start tour. User's access to the Quick Start is reviewed
based on array of resource actions. In order for the user to see the Quick Start and take its tour, his access review needs to pass all the listed resources actions.

#### Air Gapped Environments

Since the supported Quick Starts CRs will be part of the `console-operator`'s manifests, they will be distributed together with image.

### Third party Quick Starts

Third party Quick Starts will need to be created by an operator after it's installed or manually by a cluster administrator.
