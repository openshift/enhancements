# Dynamic Plugins for OpenShift Console

## Release Signoff Checklist

- [x] Enhancement is `implementable`
- [x] Design details are appropriately documented from clear requirements
- [x] Test plan is defined
- [x] Graduation criteria for dev preview, tech preview, GA
- [x] User-facing documentation is created in [openshift-docs](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/web_console/dynamic-plugin/overview-dynamic-plugin.html)

## Summary

OpenShift Console currently has
[static plugins](https://github.com/openshift/console/tree/master/frontend/packages/console-plugin-sdk)
that allow teams to contribute features to the UI such as CNV and ODF. These plugins live in a
[packages directory](https://github.com/openshift/console/tree/master/frontend/packages)
inside the `openshift/console` repo and extend console through a well-defined
plugin API. Static plugins are built with console and included in the console
image. There are currently over a half-dozen plugins.

In addition to static plugins, we'd like to introduce dynamic plugins. Dynamic
plugins are contributed by operators and loaded at runtime. Eventually we want
to migrate static plugins to dynamic plugins to decouple them from the console
and allow plugins to be updated more frequently.

## Motivation

Static plugins have worked well, but they have some limitations:

1. Static plugins can only be updated on the OpenShift release cadence. We want
   to enable plugin teams to move faster.
1. Static plugins are tied to the console version, not the component operator
   version. We want to be able to update plugins as operators change APIs or
   add features. The right version of the plugin should be used for the
   installed version of the operator.

We already have a half-dozen teams contributing to console. We need to be able
to scale as more teams contribute. This will be difficult if everyone is
contributing to a single monorepo.

### Goals

* Operators can deliver console plugins separate from the console image and
  update plugins when the operator updates.
* The dynamic plugin API is similar to the static plugin API to ease migration.
* Plugins can use shared console components such as list and details page components.
* Shared components from core will be part of a well-defined plugin API.
* Plugins can use [Patternfly 4](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/) components.
* Cluster admins control what plugins are enabled.
* Misbehaving plugins should not break console.
* Existing static plugins are not affected and will continue to work as expected.
* Plugins can declare the version of the console framework they support and
  will be disabled when their version requirements are not met.

### Non-Goals

* We can't prevent breaking changes in Patternfly APIs the console exposes to plugins.
* Plugins won't be sandboxed. They will have full JavaScript access to the DOM and network.
* This proposal does not cover allowing plugins to contribute backend console endpoints.

## Proposal

### User Stories

#### Story 1

As a user of OpenShift, I should be able to utilize the currently installed operator
APIs and features in console frontend via plugins delivered through these operators.

#### Story 2

As a developer of OpenShift, I should be able to develop, build and deploy plugins
on the cluster to expose APIs and features of the given operator in console frontend.

#### Story 3

As an admin of an OpenShift cluster, I should be able to list plugins available on
the cluster and enable/disable plugins upon operator install or at any point later.

### Module Federation

Console will use [Webpack module federation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/)
to load plugins at runtime. Module federation allows a JavaScript application
to dynamically load code from another application while sharing dependencies.
It also allows console to share its components with plugins built and bundled
separately.

Plugins will need to be built with Webpack 5+ which includes native support for
module federation.

Refer to
[dynamic plugins](https://github.com/openshift/console/tree/master/frontend/packages/console-dynamic-plugin-sdk)
README for technical details on module federation and plugin development.

### Shared Dependencies

Console will expose React and Patternfly 4 as shared dependencies to plugins.
Plugins can use any Patternfly component. Only a single version of React and
Patternfly will be loaded.

Plugins will not be able to use legacy Patternfly 3 components.

### Delivering Plugins

Plugins are delivered through operators. The operator will create a deployment
on the platform with an HTTP server to host the plugin and expose it using a
Kubernetes `Service`. The HTTP server serves all assets for the plugin,
including JSON, JavaScript, CSS, and images. The `Service` must use HTTPS and a
[service serving certificate](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/security/certificates/service-serving-certificate.html).
The console backend will proxy the plugin assets from the `Service` using the
service CA bundle.

Operators declare that they have a console plugin available by creating a
cluster-scoped `ConsolePlugin` resource, that includes information about
the backend service name, port, and base path used to access all of the
plugin's assets.

```yaml
apiVersion: console.openshift.io/v1
kind: ConsolePlugin
metadata:
  name: acm
spec:
  displayName: 'Advanced Cluster Management'
  backend:
    type: Service
    service:
      name: acm
      namespace: open-cluster-management
      port: 8443
      basePath: '/'
```

In case the plugin needs to communicate with some in-cluster service, it can
declare a service proxy in its `ConsolePlugin` resource using the `spec.proxy` array.
Each entry needs to specify type and alias of the proxy, under the `type` and `alias` field.
Proxy request could be done to different endpoints types. For the `Service` proxy type,
a `service` field with `name`, `namespace` and `port` fields needs to be specified,
to which the request will be proxied.

```yaml
spec:
  proxy:
  - type: Service
    alias: <proxy-alias>
    endpoint:
      type: Service
      service:
        name: <service-name>
        namespace: <service-namespace>
        port: <service-port>
```

Console backend exposes following endpoint in order to proxy the communication
between plugin and the service:
`/api/proxy/plugin/<plugin-name>/<proxy-alias>/<request-path>?<optional-query-parameters>`

An example proxy request path from `acm` plugin with a `search` service is:
`/api/proxy/plugin/acm/search/pods?namespace=openshift-apiserver`

Proxied request will use
[service CA bundle](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/security/certificate_types_descriptions/service-ca-certificates.html)
by default. The service must use HTTPS. If the service uses a custom service
CA, the `caCertificate` field must contain the certificate bundle. In case the
service proxy request needs to contain logged-in user's OpenShift access token,
the `authorize` field needs to be set to `true`. The user's OpenShift access
token will be then passed in the HTTP `Authorization` request header, for
example:

`Authorization: Bearer sha256~kV46hPnEYhCWFnB85r5NrprAxggzgb6GOeLbgcKNsH0`

```yaml
apiVersion: console.openshift.io/v1
kind: ConsolePlugin
metadata:
  name: acm
spec:
  displayName: 'Advanced Cluster Management'
  backend:
    type: Service
    service:
      name: acm
      namespace: open-cluster-management
      port: 8443
      basePath: '/'
  proxy:
  - type: Service
    alias: search
    caCertificate: '-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIID....'
    authorize: true
    endpoint:
      service:
        name: search
        namespace: open-cluster-management
        port: 8443
```

Plugins are disabled by default. They need to be manually enabled by a cluster
administrator before console loads any plugin code. Console provides a UI
for enabling plugins, and the list of enabled plugins is set in the console
operator config.

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Console
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  managementState: Managed
  plugins:
  - my-plugin
```

This will trigger a new rollout of the console `Deployment` with the updated
plugins. Note that this does mean the user will need to refresh the browser
to see the new plugins.

An operator can also give console a hint that it has a plugin available through
the `console.openshift.io/plugins` annotations. The annotation tells the
console to show a checkbox to enable plugins during operator install. Only
users who can edit the console operator config will see the checkbox. The
annotation value is a serialized JSON array of strings, where each item is the
name of a `ConsolePlugin` resource the operator will create.

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterServiceVersion
metadata:
  annotations:
    console.openshift.io/plugins: '["my-plugin"]'
```

For operators from the `redhat-operators` catalog source, the install operator
page will check the plugin checkbox by default. For other operators, the
checkbox will not be checked by default. Any plugin can be enabled or disabled
later through the console cluster settings page.

Initially, the console will have an allowlist of plugin names that it will
load. Only plugins with those names will be loaded until we expand support.

### Loading Plugins

The console backend will proxy requests to the plugin `Service`. This way the
`Service` itself does not need to be exposed outside the cluster, and avoids
any same-origin or certificate errors in the browser loading JavaScript from a
separate domain.

When loaded in the browser, console will read the manifest for each plugin. The
manifest is a JSON document that contains metadata about the plugin and the
extensions. `extensions` mirrors the API used for static plugins, and the same
extension points will be available.

```json
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "displayName": "My Plugin",
  "dependencies": {
    "@console/pluginAPI": "4.8.x"
  },
  "extensions": [
    {
      "type": "console.flag",
      "properties": {
        "handler": { "$codeRef": "example.testHandler" }
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "console.flag/model",
      "properties": {
        "flag": "EXAMPLE",
        "model": { "group": "example.com", "version": "v1", "kind": "ExampleModel" }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

An extension may contain code references, encoded as object literals
`{ $codeRef: string }`. The value of `$codeRef` is `moduleName.exportName` or
`moduleName` (equivalent to `moduleName.default`). Webpack itself will resolve
the remote module when console calls `container.get` on the
[remote container](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/#dynamic-remote-containers).

### Lazy Loading

Console uses
[code splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/) to only load
JavaScript code when needed. Likewise, dynamic plugin code will only load when
needed. For instance, if the plugin contributes a list page, the plugin code
for that list page only loads when the user visits the page. This improves
performance and guards against bugs in plugins the user is not actively using.

Console performs feature detection on initial load. This is used today to
enable or disable parts of the UI based on features in the cluster and is
typically driven by the resources found during API discovery. Dynamic plugins
will also be able to declare console feature flags and will only load if the
flag is enabled. For instance, the KubeVirt plugin will only load if the
`VirtualMachine` resource is present.

### Refreshing When a Plugin Updates

Dynamic plugin code won't update in the browser automatically when a plugin is
added, removed, or updated. The user must refresh the browser.

The console backend will expose an endpoint that lists the available plugins
and the current plugin version from each manifest. The frontend will poll this
endpoint periodically to detect changes. When a change is detected, console
shows a message in a toast notification indicating that there is an update
available and the user must refresh their browser to see the changes. (We won't
refresh the page automatically to avoid possibly losing data if the user is
entering something into a form or the YAML editor.)

### Localization

Info on how Console is handling i18n is in this [enhancement](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/console/internationalization.md).

Console uses [react-i18next](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next) for i18n,
and dynamic plugins must use react-i18next as well.

All dynamic plugins must use a single react-i18next [namespace](https://www.i18next.com/principles/namespaces),
named after the plugin, e.g. for `kubevirt` the filename would be
`plugin__kubevirt.json`. Localization resources need to be served
by the plugin service under the `locales/{language}/{namespace}.json`
path relative to the `basePath` defined in the `ConsolePlugin` resource.
All dynamic plugins must use the `plugin__` namespace prefix, e.g.
`plugin__knative` or `plugin__kubevirt`. The request for the dynamic
plugin localization resources will be proxied by console backend.
For example, the `kubevirt` plugin localization resource
in the `en` language will be requested at path
`/locales/en/plugin__kubevirt.json`

Here's a code example of how the `kubevirt` plugin would translate a message:
```js
const VMHeading = () => {
  const { t } = useTranslation();
  return <h1>{t('plugin__kubevirt~Virtual Machine')}</h1>;
};
```

In the `v1` API version, an additional `spec.i18n.loadType` field introduced for defining the loading type of i18n resrouces that
given dynamic plugin contains. If the `loadType` is set to `Preload`, console will load all plugin's localization resources during
loading of the plugin. If the `loadType` is set to `Lazy` or left blank, console wont preload any plugin's localization resources,
instead will leave thier loading to runtime's lazy-loading.
The i18n namespace name follows `plugin__{plugin-name}` naming convention.

```yaml
apiVersion: console.openshift.io/v1
kind: ConsolePlugin
metadata:
  name: acm
spec:
  displayName: 'Advanced Cluster Management'
  i18n:
    loadType: Preload
```

In the 4.11 release, a `console.openshift.io/use-i18n` annotation
is being introduced. The annotation indicates whether the `ConsolePlugin` contains
localization resources. If the annotation is set to `"true"`, the localization
resources from the i18n namespace named after the dynamic plugin (e.g. `plugin__kubevirt`),
are loaded. If the annotation is set to any other value or is missing on the `ConsolePlugin`
resource, localization resources are not loaded.
Note: All API versions of `ConsolePlugin` are checked for this annotation. The annotation
should only be used by plugins that need to work with 4.10 and 4.11. This annotation will
be removed when 4.10 goes out of support in favor of the proper API.

Prior to 4.11 release, localization resources are being loaded by default. In case these
resources are not present in the dynamic plugin, the initial console load will be slowed 
down. For more info check [BZ#2015654](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2015654)

### Error Handling

Console will guard against runtime errors in plugins. All plugin components
will be surrounded by [React error boundaries](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html).
This prevents an uncaught error from causing the application to white-screen
and break. If a plugin service is unavailable, console will not load the plugin
and show a message in the notification drawer to let users know.

Additionally, console users can disable specific or all dynamic plugins that
would normally get loaded by console via `?disable-plugins` query parameter.
The value of this parameter is either a comma separated list of plugin names
(disable specific plugins) or an empty string (disable all plugins).

### Risks and Mitigations

**Risk**: Patternfly updates with breaking API changes can break plugins.

**Mitigation**: Plugins can declare a semver range for compatibility. The core
console team will coordinate breaking changes with the plugin teams so that a
new operator version will be available with fixes when the corresponding
OpenShift version GAs. We will not ship any breaking Patternfly changes in a
z-stream.

**Risk**: Plugins are not sandboxed and can make any API request on behalf of the user.

**Mitigation**: Plugins are not enabled by default. A cluster admin must opt-in.

## Design Details

### Test Plan

In some ways, dynamic plugins will simplify how we test since each plugin has
its own repo. Plugins like KubeVirt and OCS have special requirements that can
be managed in their own merge queues.

The core console repo will run e2e tests on a sample plugin that exercises the
dynamic plugin extension points. The tests will install the sample plugin and
verify that the contributions to different areas of the UI work as expected.
We'll make the sample plugin available as a reference for other teams
developing dynamic plugins.

Additionally, we'll add API test suites to make sure we don't break API compatibility.

Manual testing of specific plugins like OCS and KubeVirt will continue as
before, including regression testing for any plugin migrated from static to
dynamic.

### Graduation Criteria

| OpenShift | Maturity     | API version   |
|-|-|-|
| 4.8       | Alpha        | v1alpha1      |
| 4.12      | GA           | v1            |

Static plugins are already a supported feature. Any existing static plugin that
is migrated to a dynamic plugin will need to have the same support level.

Both `v1` and `v1alpha1` version are supported. `v1alpha1` plugins will get
converted by the conversion webhook server into `v1` representation.
Conversion webhook server is part of the `console-operator` pod.

#### Dev Preview -> Tech Preview

None

#### Tech Preview -> GA

None

#### Removing a deprecated feature

None

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

We'll need to make sure any static plugin we remove has a dynamic plugin ready.
OLM index images where operators are locked to a specific OpenShift version
will allow us to do this. We can make sure the right operator level is required
for the release where we remove the static plugin. The console operator will
default well-known plugins to enabled when transitioned from static to dynamic
on cluster upgrade if the operator is installed.

A plugin might be unavailable for a window during a cluster upgrade if the
console version and operator are at different versions.

### Version Skew Strategy

We cannot prevent dependencies like Patternfly from releasing API breaking
changes, so we need a way for plugins to specify version compatibility. This
can also be helpful for operators who depend on new plugin APIs that are only
available in certain OpenShift versions.

Plugins can declare a compatible OpenShift semver version range in the plugin
manifest using the `@console/pluginAPI` property. The console will only load
plugins for compatible OpenShift versions.

An operator could contribute multiple plugins with different version ranges to
support different OpenShift versions. If the version ranges don't overlap, the
console will only load the correct plugin.

## Implementation History

* 2020-07-24 - Initial [dynamic plugin PR](https://github.com/openshift/console/pull/6101) opened.
* 2020-11-26 - Allow static plugins to use new extension types with code references
  ([console#7163](https://github.com/openshift/console/pull/7163)).
* 2021-06-22 - Support localization of dynamic plugins
* 2021-10-06 - Allow dynamic plugins to proxy to services on the cluster
* 2022-05-13 - API enhancements for GA
* 2023-01-17 - GA (OpenShift 4.12)

## Drawbacks

* It will be harder to coordinate changes across core console and plugins since
  they no longer share a repo.
* We have to handle version skew between plugins and core console.

## Alternatives

RHACM has an architecture where each component is a microservice that
contributes its own UI behind a single ingress with a shared masthead and
navigation. We could adopt this architecture for OpenShift console, and it
would allow us to more easily integrate RHACM and OpenShift console.

Drawbacks to this approach for OpenShift console:

* It would require significant rework to both core console and plugin code
  since console has a different architecture today.
* It might not be possible to achieve feature parity with current static
  plugins since they extend existing console pages. For instance, the OCS
  plugins contributes dashboard tabs to the Home -> Overview page to add
  dashboard tabs, and the Knative plugin adds capabilities to the developer
  topology view.

We could consider a hybrid approach where RHACM and OpenShift console
integrate in this way, but we support module federation for the existing
console plugins.
