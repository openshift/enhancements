# OKD Enhancement Proposals

An OKD Enhancement Proposal is a way to propose, communicate, and coordinate on new efforts for the OKD project.

It is inspired from our experience with the Kubernetes Enhancement process where many of our community participants collaborate each day.

This process is evolving, but is mandatory for all enhancements beginning with release-4.3.

## Quick start

1. Socialize an idea with others.  Make sure others think the work is worth doing, and are willing to review design and code changes required.
2. Follow the process outlined in the [enhancement template](enhancement_template.md).

## FAQs

### Do I have to use the process?

If the enhancement has broad scope, yes.  It helps everyone track why, when, how, and by whom work is done.

### Why would I want to use the process?

Provide a mechanism to communicate design and implementation strategies across the OKD community.

### Do I put design in a particular directory?

If it has broad impact, place it in the root of [the `enhancements` directory](../enhancements).  If it's localized to a particular domain, find the appropriate subdirectory.

### Do I have to use the Oxford comma?

Yes. OKD is an open, inclusive, and diverse community, and there is absolutely no room for ambiguous clauses.

### Is it “bare metal”, “baremetal”, “bare-metal”, “Baremetal”, or “BareMetal”?

Follow the [style guide from
metal3-io](https://github.com/metal3-io/metal3-docs/blob/master/design/bare-metal-style-guide.md)
