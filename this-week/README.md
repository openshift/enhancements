# This Week in Enhancements

An experiment to produce a weekly newsletter highlighting the activity that has
occurred in the OpenShift enhancements repository.

Goals:
* Make it easy to keep up with activity
* Encourage participation
* Encourage people to read about new things they may not have otherwise read
