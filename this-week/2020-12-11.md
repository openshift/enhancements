- [501](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/501): (0/22) cluster-logging: LOG-928: Creating elasticsearch hot warm phase architecture proposal (ewolinetz)

  > The purpose of this is to increase the configuration for an ES
  > cluster to better optimize indices and cluster priorities and
  > maintain that they can still be queried. This has a potential to
  > improve retention of our logs (but is not our focus). Currently
  > our logs are either maintained as a high priority index or they
  > are deleted. We seek to emulate the back-end process that
  > Elasticsearch makes available in the form of [x-pack
  > API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/index-lifecycle-management-api.html)
  > end points.

## New Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 New pull requests:

- [560](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/560): (9/9) general: single-node production deployment approach (dhellmann)

  > This enhancement describes the approach to deploying single-node production OpenShift instances without using a cluster profile.
  >
  > A cluster deployed in this way will differ from the default `self-managed-highly-available` cluster profile in several significant ways:
  >
  > * The single node serves as both the clusterâ€™s control plane and as a   worker node.
  > * Many operators will be configured to reduce the footprint of their   operands, such as by running fewer replicas.
  > * In-place upgrades will not be supported by the first iteration of   single-node deployments.
  >
  > One example of this use case is seen in telecommunication service providers implementation of a Radio Access Network (RAN). This use case is discussed in more detail below.
  >
  > The approach described here is an alternative to using a cluster
  > profile, as was detailed in
  > [#504](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/504). With a
  > few changes to existing operators that would also be needed for a
  > profile-based approach, and with the high-availability mode API
  > described in
  > [#555](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/555), it is
  > possible to produce single-node deployments without introducing a
  > new cluster profile.

- [561](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/561): (0/0) network: Initial proposal of "allow-from-router" NetworkPolicy (danwinship)

  > Many users want to create NetworkPolicies that say, effectively,
  > "allow traffic from routers". However, the router can run with one
  > of several different "endpoint publishing strategies", which use
  > the cluster network differently, and when using the `HostNetwork`
  > strategy, the NetworkPolicy-relevant behavior also varies
  > depending on the network plugin in use. This makes it impossible
  > to create an "allow traffic from routers" policy that will work in
  > any cluster. Indeed, in some cases, it is difficult to create such
  > a policy even just for a single cluster, even when you know
  > exactly how the cluster is configured.

- [562](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/562): (0/0) security: Enhancing SCC to Gate Runtime Classes (haircommander)

  > Enhance the Openshift SCC with two fields called `AllowRuntimeClasses` and `EnsureRuntimeClasses`, which gate users from specifying runtime classes in their Pod requests.
