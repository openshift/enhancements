# This Week in Enhancements - 2020-09-04

This is the second weekly edition of this experiment to provide a weekly digest
newsletter of activity in the OpenShift enhancements repository.

As a request to enhancement authors, please try to capture the area of your
enhancement in the summary line.  That will make it easier to determine what
the enhancement is related to when seeing it in a list of 1-liner summaries
either in this list, via email subjects, or when looking at the list of open PRs.

## Merged Enhancements

*<PR ID>: (comments this week / total comments) summary*

There were 8 Merged pull requests:
	      
[259](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/259): (3/5) Add Machine Config Support in NTO proposal.

	      This enhancement proposes adding the ability for admins to target 
          MachineConfigPools and create MachineConfigs through the Node Tuning 
          Operator.  With this enhancement we can take another step towards 
          full support for tuned profiles that need `[bootloader]`
          support on RHCOS.

This feature was actually implemented several months ago, but the enhancement
was never merged.  It was updated to reflect that it was already implemented
and then merged this week.

[356](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/356): (0/59) network: on premise Service load balancers

	      OpenShift does not currently support Services of type=LoadBalancer on
	      bare metal or other on premise infrastructure environments. This
	      enhancement proposes a way forward, which is to adopt MetalLB.
	      
	      The document explores some high level requirements, discusses some
	      alternatives considered, and maps out how we would get to work on
	      this through technical due diligence, upstream community engagement,
	      and careful planning of OpenShift integration with a new operator.
	      
	      There is not currently a target for when this would be fully
	      supported, as this is a proposed enhancement on a direction to take.
	      More extensive technical due diligence, development, and testing will
	      help define the roadmap over time.

[394](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/394): (0/44) Discuss host network configuration interfaces

	      This change introduces a new enhancement that discusses host network
	      configuration. It is different from the typical enhancement in that
	      its goal is informational and to discuss what is already present in
	      this area. It also provides references to other related works in
	      progress.
	      
	      I wrote this first for myself and propose it here in hopes that it
	      may help others. I find that this context is important and helpful to
	      understand when discussing or reviewing enhancements for a specific
	      feature related to host network configuration.
	      
	      I imagine this as a living document that should get updated as key
	      improvements are made to how we manage host network configuration for
	      OpenShift.
          
[455](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/455): (3/10) network: add port registry

	      This document isn't exactly an enhancement. Rather it captures host
	      ports, so developers know which ones they can use.
	               
[457](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/457): (1/3) Enhancment: Select logs By pod label

	      Add an input selector to the ClusterLogForwarder (CLF) to forward
	      application logs from pods identified by labels.
	      
	      Kubernetes has two ways to identify pods: namespaces and labels. The
	      CLF already has an input selector for namespaces, this enhancement will
	      add a selector for labels.

[464](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/464): (1/1) use 'share' instead of 'projectedResourceName' in csi driver yaml examples
[465](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/465): (12/12) Insights operator up to date gathering

This one generated the most comments on a new enhancement this week.  The
enhancement proposes a specific method to decouple the Insights Operator from
OpenShift releases, using examples of a drawn out backport process as an
example for why this is desirable.  The discussion has highlighted that
becoming an OLM operator that could be installed by default could be a more
general solution to the problem raised, though this would take significant
effort to accomplish.  Ongoing improvements to the backport process and
timeline could also reduce the pressure that led to the proposal.
