- [802](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/802): (3/3) general: WIP Workload partitioning API enhancement (MarSik)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress, priority/important-soon`

### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [753](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/753): (15/39) workload-partitioning: add plan for configuration and enablement ownership (dhellmann)

  `priority/important-soon`

  > The initial iteration of workload partitioning focused on a short path
  > to a minimum viable implementation. This enhancement describes the
  > loose ends for preparing the feature for GA at a high level, and
  > explains the set of other design documents that need to be written
  > separately during the next iteration.

- [593](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/593): (1/132) general: Add proposal for hiding container mountpoints from systemd (lack)

  `lifecycle/stale, priority/important-soon`

  > The current implementation of Kubelet and CRI-O both use the top-level
  > namespace for all container and Kubelet mountpoints. However, moving these
  > container-specific mountpoints into a private namespace reduced systemd
  > overhead with no difference in functionality.
