There were 4 New pull requests:

- [1545](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1545): (94/94) microshift: USHIFT-2186: Multus CNI for MicroShift (pmtk) ([OCPSTRAT-473](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPSTRAT-473))

  `jira/valid-reference`

  > Currently MicroShift ships [ovn-kubernetes](https://github.com/openshift/ovn-kubernetes) (ovn-k)
  > CNI responsible for connectivity within and outside the cluster.
  > There are users that have needs beyond what ovn-k offers like adding more interfaces to the Pods.
  > Some example requirements are connecting Pods to the host's bridge interface or setting up complex networking based on VLAN.
  > This functionality is Multus' trademark - adding additional interfaces to Pods.
  >
  > This enhancement explores providing Multus CNI as an optional component to MicroShift.

- [1546](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1546): (11/11) workload-partitioning: OCPEDGE-808: feat: add ep for cpu limits with workload partitioning (eggfoobar) ([OCPEDGE-57](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPEDGE-57))

  `jira/valid-reference`

  > This enhancements builds on top of the [Management Workload
  > Partitioning](management-workload-partitioning.md) enhancement to provide the
  > ability for workload partitioning to take into account CPU limits during Pod
  > admission. Currently only CPU requests are used during Pod admission and any Pod
  > that uses CPU limits is ignored. With this change the Pod admission webhook will
  > take into account CPU limits and use the existing mechanism to pass the CPU
  > limits information to the underlying container runtime.

- [1548](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1548): (49/49) microshift: USHIFT-2089: Add router configuration options (pacevedom) ([USHIFT-2089](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-2089))

  `jira/valid-reference`

  > MicroShift's default router is created as part of the platform, but does not
  > allow configuring any of its specific parameters. For example, you can not
  > disable the router or change its listening ports.
  >
  > In order to allow these operations and many more, a set of configuration options
  > is proposed.

- [1549](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1549): (12/12) etcd: ETCD-514: Add etcd size tuning (dusk125) ([ETCD-514](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ETCD-514))

  `jira/valid-reference`

  > Thie enhancement would replace the hardcoded value for the etcd backend database quota with predefined profiles.
  > Each profile would map to predefined, and pretested, values for the internal parameter.
  > This would allow for some user tweaking without giving them access to the full range of values.
  > This enhancement only covers the mvp for a tech preview release of this new feature; a future enhancement will be necessary.
