## Merged Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 6 Merged pull requests:

- [352](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/352): (1/13) storage: Rework CSI driver installation to CVO / cluster-storage-operator (jsafrane)

  > We want certain CSI drivers such as AWS, GCE, Cinder, Azure and vSphere to be installable on OpenShift, so as:
  > * They can be used along-side in-tree drivers and when upstream enables migration flag for these volume types, their   replacement CSI drivers can take over and none of the storage features get affected.
  > * OpenShift provides native storage provided by underlying cloud out of the box after installation for the clouds that   don't have in-tree volume plugins in Kubernetes.

- [389](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/389): (0/62) subscription-content: Subscription Injection Operator (adambkaplan)

  > This enhancement will allow any workload to access RHEL subscription content via a pod annotation.

- [493](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/493): (4/65) storage: Add vsphere csi operator enhancement (gnufied)

  > This enhancement proposes deployment of vSphere CSI driver on Openshift as a default component.

There were 4 New pull requests:

- [522](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/522): (8/8) olm: Update OLM managed operator metrics enhancement (awgreene)

  > The primary purpose of this enhancement is to enable
  > [Operator-Lifecycle-Manager
  > (OLM)](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager)
  > managed operators to easily integrate with the [Prometheus
  > Operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator) on
  > OpenShift and Vanilla Kubernetes Clusters. Additionally, this
  > enhancement focuses on enabling OLM managed operators to record
  > metrics with the [OpenShift
  > Monitoring](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-monitoring-operator)
  > Prometheus Operator present on all OpenShift Clusters.
  >
  > OLM will support tight integration with the Prometheus Operator by allowing operator authors to package `ServiceMonitor` and `PrometheusRule` objects within their [Operator Bundle](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-registry/blob/master/docs/design/operator-bundle.md) and will manage these resources alongside the lifecycle of the operator.
  >
  > OLM will also define how an operator author can surface the following information in the [OpenShift Console UI](https://github.com/openshift/console) when a Cluster Admin is installing an operator, which will be needed when integrating with with OpenShift's Monitoring services:
  >
  >- A suggested namespace that the operator should be deployed to.
  >- That the operator exposes metrics that should be scraped by the OpenShift Monitoring Prometheus instance present on all OpenShift clusters.

- [524](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/524): (0/0) network: New method for providing configurable  self-hosted LB/DNS/VIP for on-prem (yboaron)

  > In the current implementation, the self-hosted DNS/LB stack runs
  > under the MCO umbrella by default in all on-prem platforms and
  > there's no option to configure it.  Some customers with high
  > production needs usually have their own external Load Balancing
  > and DNS resolution. In addition, there are cases in which some
  > traffic used to provide these self-hosted services is disallowed
  > in the customer's network.
  >
  > The outcome of such scenarios is that cluster's resources are spent on providing unused services and generating traffic against certain customers network design.
  >
  > This enhancement suggests a new method for providing the self-hosted stack.   *Note:* as per the OCP plan to move API and Ingress to K8S SLB, this direction should be investigated deeper after MetalLb will be integrated.

- [525](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/525): (0/0) machine-config: WIP: Add FCCT support in MC proposal (LorbusChris)

  > Proposal to add support for Fedora CoreOS Config (FCC) in the Config field of MachineConfig (MC) resources.
  >
  > The Config field is of the `runtime.RawExtension` type and can
  > therefore contain arbitrary data. The machine-config-operator
  > (MCO) currently supports parsing the RawExtension contents for
  > Ignition spec v2.2, v3.0 and v3.1 configuration. Internally, the
  > configuration from all MachineConfig objects are translated to
  > spec v3.1 and merged into a rendered MC which represents the
  > canonical state the MCO enforces. FCC is more human friendly to
  > write and read than Ignition config, and can be transpiled to
  > Ignition spec v3.1 config safely with the Fedora CoreOS Config
  > Transpiler (FCCT). Support for FCCs can be added by adding the
  > FCCT parser to the RawExtension processing chain.

- [527](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/527): (6/6) installer: enhancement/installer: check OpenStack versions (EmilienM)

  > OpenShift can only be installed on supported versions of
  > OpenStack. While the [Support
  > Matrix](https://access.redhat.com/articles/4679401) is well
  > documented, the OpenShift installer doesn't check which version of
  > OpenStack is running before attempting an operation
  > (e.g. installation).  Running OpenShift over an unsupported
  > version of OpenStack is problematic and can lead to unstable
  > infrastructure. To avoid that, it is proposed to programmatically
  > verify the version of OpenStack is supported otherwise stop and
  > fail.
