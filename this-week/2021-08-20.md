## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Other Merged pull requests:

- [468](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/468): (13/68) machine-api: Add dedicated instances proposal (alexander-demichev)

  > Make it possible for users to create machines which run as dedicated instances. Dedicated instances are instances
  > that usually run on hardware that's dedicated to a single customer.

- [683](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/683): (57/319) insights: Insights Operator pulling and exposing data from the OCM API (tremes)

  > This enhancement will enable the Insights Operator to pull the Simple Content Access certs for using RHEL subscription content
  > from the OCM (OpenShift Cluster Manager) API. The certificates will be exposed by the Insights Operator
  > in the OpenShift API to allow users to use them when consuming and building container images
  > on the platform.


### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Other New pull requests:

- [870](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/870): (2/2) update: Versioning cincinnati api and json schema (PratikMahajan)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > As of today, we declare the schema version in Cincinnati Graph URI. We currently, do not embed the version information
  > in json schema. The enhancement will embed the version information in the json schema. This has the benefit of being
  > easy to implement and to pass around if we ship Cincinnati JSON over non-HTTP channels. Enhancement will also implement
  > media type versioning while requesting the graph e.g. `ContentType: application/vnd.redhat.cincinnati.v1+json`.
  > The move to supplying requested version in media type field will require us to move towards a generic un-versioned Graph
  > URI, with the move, we'll still support old URI for foreseeable future.

- [871](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/871): (1/1) baremetal: MPINSTALL-7: Enable Baremetal on other Platforms to support ZTP (asalkeld)

  > BMO is only available when deploying an OpenShift cluster with the baremetal
  > platform (via the IPI or AI workflow). Having the ability to manage baremetal nodes from
  > clusters without requiring the cluster to be on baremetal would be beneficial
  > to customers.
