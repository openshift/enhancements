- [875](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/875): (7/7) console: Console: expose network features (mariomac)

  > The Console may need to show some fields that are exclusive to a given CNI type, and hide the fields that are not
  > provided by it. Then the console needs visibility about which CNI (`OpenShiftSDN` or `OVNKubernetes`) features
  > are available, depending on each customer's configuration.
  >
  > This information should be available to all users (or, at this moment, to any user able to create
  > a Network Policy).

  > endpoint publishing strategy type.

  > To ensure that ironic-python-agent runs on top of an up-to-date OS, we will
  > update the CoreOS image URLs in the baremetal Provisioning CR to the latest
  > specified by the release metadata. For users running disconnected installs, we
  > will require them to make the latest versions available and block further
  > upgrades until they do so.
