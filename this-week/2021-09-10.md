### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 4 Other New pull requests:

- [887](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/887): (4/4) ingress: NE-542 Expose router compression variables (candita)

  > This enhancement proposal extends the IngressController API to allow the cluster administrator
  > to configure HTTP traffic compression via HAProxy variables.  HTTP traffic compression increases the
  > performance of a website by reducing the size of data that is passed in HTTP transactions.

- [890](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/890): (1/1) network: Introduce DPU OVNKube Operator (pliurh)

  > To facilitate the management of Nvidia BlueField-2 Smart-NIC, a two-cluster
  > design is proposed. Under such design, a BlueFiled-2 card will be provisioned as
  > a worker node of the ARM-based infra cluster, whereas the tenant cluster where
  > the normal user applications run on, is composed of the X86 servers.
  >
  > The OVN-Kubernetes components are spread over the two clusters. On the tenant
  > cluster side, the Cluster Network Operator is in charge of the management of the
  > ovn-kube components. On the infra cluster side, We propose to create a new
  > operator to be responsible for the life-cycle management of ovn-kube components.

- [893](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/893): (3/3) ingress: [fix] Ingress custom http error pages (lgchiaretto)

  `needs-ok-to-test`

  > There is no supported method to customize an IngressController's error pages in OCP 4.
  > Users may want to customize an IngressController's error pages for branding or other reasons.
  > For example, users may want a custom HTTP 503 error page to be returned if no pod is available.
  > When the requested URI does not exist, users may want an IngressController to return a custom 404 page.
