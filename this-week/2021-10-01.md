# This Week in Enhancements - 2021-10-01

## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [867](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/867): (6/156) node-tuning: Move PAO to OCP enhancement (MarSik)

  `priority/important-soon`

  > The [Performance Addon Operator](https://github.com/openshift-kni/performance-addon-operators) is a component that makes it easier to configure an OCP cluster for low latency and real-time purposes [OCP docs](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/scalability_and_performance/cnf-performance-addon-operator-for-low-latency-nodes.html).
  > It is a high level orchestrator that consumes a [Performance Profile](https://github.com/openshift-kni/performance-addon-operators/blob/master/docs/interactions/performance-profile.yaml) and generates multiple manifests that are then processed by core OpenShift components like MCO and NTO.
  > We have a simplified interaction diagram here: https://github.com/openshift-kni/performance-addon-operators/blob/master/docs/interactions/diagram.png
  > A more in depth description of how a low latency tuned cluster works was presented at DevConf 2021: https://devconfcz2021.sched.com/event/gmJD/openshift-for-low-latency-and-real-time-workloads
  >
  > The proposal in hand is to move the existing implementation of PAO under
  > [cluster node tuning operator (NTO)](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-node-tuning-operator) without adding new features.

- [593](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/593): (1/138) general: Add proposal for hiding container mountpoints from systemd (lack)

  `lifecycle/rotten, priority/important-soon`

  > The current implementation of Kubelet and CRI-O both use the top-level
  > namespace for all container and Kubelet mountpoints. However, moving these
  > container-specific mountpoints into a private namespace reduced systemd
  > overhead with no difference in functionality.


## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 5 Other Merged pull requests:

- [841](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/841): (8/60) builds: Remove Jenkins from the OCP Payload (adambkaplan)

  > This proposal aims to remove Jenkins images from the OCP payload and replace them with images delivered via CPaaS.

- [870](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/870): (6/63) update: Versioning cincinnati api and json schema (PratikMahajan)

  > As of today, we declare the schema version in Cincinnati Graph URI. We currently, do not embed the version information
  > in json schema. The enhancement will embed the version information in the json schema. This has the benefit of being
  > easy to implement and to pass around if we ship Cincinnati JSON over non-HTTP channels. The enhancement will also begin
  > versioning Cincinnati payloads by media type, for example `application/vnd.redhat.cincinnati.v1+json`.
  > The move to supplying requested version in media type field will require us to move towards a generic un-versioned Graph
  > URI, with the move, we'll still support old URI for foreseeable future.

- [875](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/875): (4/32) console: Console: expose network features (mariomac)

  > The Console may need to show some fields that are exclusive to a given CNI type, and hide the fields that are not
  > provided by it. Then the console needs visibility about which CNI (`OpenShiftSDN` or `OVNKubernetes`) features
  > are available, depending on each customer's configuration.
  >
  > This information should be available to all users (or, at this moment, to any user able to create
  > a Network Policy).

### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 4 Other New pull requests:

- [912](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/912): (10/10) installer: Enhancement proposal for OpenShift IPI on Nutanix AOS with AHV (vnephologist)

  `ok-to-test`

  > This enhancement proposes adding support for OpenShift 4 Installer Provisioned Infrastructure (IPI) on Nutanix AOS infrastructure with Nutanix AHV hypervisor. It describes the necessary enhancements, tooling and documentation to enable this capability.

- [913](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/913): (31/31) machine-api: Add cluster-api integration enhancement (alexander-demichev)

  > This enhancement describes the process of integrating the upstream [Cluster API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api)
  > project into OpenShift standalone clusters.

- [914](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/914): (2/2) cluster-scope-secret-volumes: BUILD-353: update with latest CRD,group,csi driver renames (gabemontero)

  > This proposal will describe a [CSI driver](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md) based
  > means for OpenShift cluster administrators to share `Secrets` / `ConfigMaps` defined in one namespace with
  > other namespaces.
  >
  > Any owners/authors/users of Pods in those namespaces can opt into the consumption of the content of those shared `Secrets` /
  >  `ConfigMaps` during their Pod's execution.
  >
  > This proposal was broken off from [a proposal on injecting RHEL entitlements/subscriptions](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/214)

- [915](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/915): (1/1) console: CONSOLE-2892: Allow dynamic plugins to proxy to services on the cluster (jhadvig)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > OpenShift Console currently has
  > [static plugins](https://github.com/openshift/console/tree/master/frontend/packages/console-plugin-sdk)
  > that allow teams to contribute features to the UI such as CNV and OCS. These plugins live in a
  > [packages directory](https://github.com/openshift/console/tree/master/frontend/packages)
  > inside the `openshift/console` repo and extend console through a well-defined
  > plugin API. Static plugins are built with console and included in the console
  > image. There are currently over a half-dozen plugins.
  >
  > In addition to static plugins, we'd like to introduce dynamic plugins. Dynamic
  > plugins are contributed by operators and loaded at runtime. Eventually we want
  > to migrate static plugins to dynamic plugins to decouple them from the console
  > and allow plugins to be updated more frequently.
