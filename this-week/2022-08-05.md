There was 1 Prioritized Merged pull request:

- [1195](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1195): (26/50) hypershift: Add state of the world enhancement for hypershift Node lifecycle (enxebre) ([OCPPLAN-5771](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPPLAN-5771))

  > This proposal fleshes out the details for the current Node lifecycle solution for HyperShift form factor i.e. hosted control planes.
  > This includes automated Machine management, OS and config lifecycle.


### Prioritized New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Prioritized New pull request:

- [1202](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1202): (159/159) storage: STOR-962: Update storage operators for HyperShift (jsafrane) ([STOR-962](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/STOR-962))

  `priority/important-soon`

  > This enhancement describes how OCP storage components will run in HyperShift's managed control plane and in the guest
  > cluster.
  >
  > The components currently are:
  >
  > * cluster-csi-snapshot-controller-operator and its operand, csi-snapshot-controller.
  > * cluster-storage operator and its operand aws-ebs-csi-driver-operator and its operand AWS EBS CSI driver.
  >   * All other CSI driver operators + CSI drivers should follow the same approach, AWS EBS is just the first one to
  >     run its control plane in HyperShift's management cluster.

- [1184](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1184): (29/43) ingress: NE-978: ingress: Add ReloadInterval Option (Ethany-RH) ([NE-586](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NE-586)) ([NE-978](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NE-978)) ([NE-979](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NE-979))

  > Add an API field to configure OpenShift router's `RELOAD_INTERVAL` environment variable so that administrators can define the minimum frequency the router is allowed to reload in order to publish new changes.
  >
  > OpenShift router currently hard-codes this reload interval to 5 seconds. It should be possible for administrators to tune this value as necessary. Based on the processes run in the cluster and the frequency that it sees new changes, increasing the minimum interval at which the router is allowed to reload can improve its efficiency.
  > This proposal extends the existing IngressController API to add a tuning option for the reload interval.

### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 6 Other New pull requests:

- [1203](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1203): (122/122) microshift: advertise cluster version details for all users (dhellmann) ([USHIFT-233](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-233)) ([show_bug.cgi?id=1850656](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1850656))

  > We have several use cases for allowing authenticated users to discover
  > whether they are communicating with OCP or MicroShift, including the
  > version of the product. We already have the ClusterVersion resource
  > for OCP, but that requires special privileges to read and is not
  > present in a MicroShift deployment. This enhancement describes a
  > standard that both platforms can use to share platform and version
  > information with API callers.

- [1204](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1204): (8/8) hypershift: Enhancement proposal for HyperShift on P/Z/A (jaypoulz)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > Enabling HyperShift across Multiple Architectures starts by extending the
  > platforms and architectures it can currently target as compute nodes. This
  > enables clusters to benefit from HyperShift's scaling on x86 while still
  > being able to target workloads on IBM Power, IBM zSystems, and ARM.
  >
  > Another driver major driver is the cost-benefit of being able to schedule
  > orchestration workloads on the lowest cost instance type costs in public cloud
  > environments. If you compare different clouds, it becomes clear that those with
  > ARM instances tend to price those very competitively. By enabling the HyperShift
  > operator on ARM, we are looking at how we can enable users to reap these cost
  > benefits for their workloads.
  >
  > Finally, looking at the IBM Power and zSystem environments, there is huge
  > potential for the benefits of being able to provision new clusters quickly in
  > these environments, as well as the potential of being able to run hybrid
  > workloads with operators or technology that is not available natively on those
  > platforms.
