### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [867](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/867): (6/162) node-tuning: Move PAO to OCP enhancement (MarSik)

  `priority/important-soon`

  > The [Performance Addon Operator](https://github.com/openshift-kni/performance-addon-operators) is a component that makes it easier to configure an OCP cluster for low latency and real-time purposes [OCP docs](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/scalability_and_performance/cnf-performance-addon-operator-for-low-latency-nodes.html).
  > It is a high level orchestrator that consumes a [Performance Profile](https://github.com/openshift-kni/performance-addon-operators/blob/master/docs/interactions/performance-profile.yaml) and generates multiple manifests that are then processed by core OpenShift components like MCO and NTO.
  > We have a simplified interaction diagram here: https://github.com/openshift-kni/performance-addon-operators/blob/master/docs/interactions/diagram.png
  > A more in depth description of how a low latency tuned cluster works was presented at DevConf 2021: https://devconfcz2021.sched.com/event/gmJD/openshift-for-low-latency-and-real-time-workloads
  >
  > The proposal in hand is to move the existing implementation of PAO under
  > [cluster node tuning operator (NTO)](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-node-tuning-operator) without adding new features.

- [838](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/838): (3/130) local-storage: KNIP-1770: Add proposal for exporting local storage device health metrics (rohantmp)

  `priority/important-soon`

  > This enhancement proposes that we export health metrics for each local device on each node.

There were 4 Other Merged pull requests:

- [899](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/899): (46/46) authentication: pod-security initial commit (s-urbaniak)

  > Kubernetes recently gained PodSecurity policy admission as part of KEP 2579 [1].
  > It is a new pod security admission plugin to enforce Kubernetes PodSecurity standards [2].
  > It is meant to replace the existing PodSecurityPolicy admission mechanism in Kubernetes.
  >
  > This enhancement describes the migration path to integrate PodSecurity admission inside OpenShift.
  > Special interest is put to design a migration scheme which lets PodSecurity coexist with the existing Security Context Constraints (SCC) mechanism.

  > [2] https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/

- [908](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/908): (28/71) kube-apiserver: Improving Supportability of API Webhooks (sttts)

  > OpenShift supports the API extensions that upstream Kubernetes has built into the kube-apiserver.
  > This especially involves webhooks for admission and for CRD conversion. This enhancement is about
  > measures to increase supportability of clusters that use official Red Hat provided add-ons (like
  > Istio, kubevirt or Open Policy Agent), but also 3rd-party add-ons (like Vault, or the community
  > variants of previously mentioned software).

#### Other Merged Pull Requests Modifying Existing Documents

- [914](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/914): (11/12) cluster-scope-secret-volumes: BUILD-353: update with latest CRD,group,csi driver renames (gabemontero)
- [915](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/915): (68/72) console: CONSOLE-2892: Allow dynamic plugins to proxy to services on the cluster (jhadvig)

### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 10 Other New pull requests:

- [918](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/918): (2/2) installer: vsphere: add multiple datacenter and clusters (jcpowermac)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > The goal of this enhancement is to provide the ability to install in a
  > vSphere enviornment with multiple datacenters and clusters. Including configuration of regions and zones in the CCM.

- [920](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/920): (19/19) etcd: ETCD-236: etcd: scaling etcd with raft learners (hexfusion)

  > Over time as clusters live longer and workloads grow the ability to scale the control-plane and replace failed nodes
  > becomes a critical part of the admins maintenance overhead. Today the `cluster-etcd-operator` manages scaling up of
  > the etcd cluster. To provide the foundation for initiatives such as scale down and vertical control plane scaling[1].
  > The `cluster-etcd-operator` must ensure proper safety mechanisms exist to adjust membership of the etcd cluster.
  >
  > Introduced in etcd v3.4 the raft learner[2] provides mitigations which reduces quorum and
  > stability issues during scaling. A learner is essentially an etcd member which is non voting thus can not impact
  > quorum but like other members will receive log replications from the leader.
  >
  > This enhancement proposes:
  > - Replacing the default scale up performed by the cluster-etcd-operator to use raft learners.
  > - Deprecation and removal of the current `discover-etcd-initial-cluster`[3] command and replacing its
  > functionality with the existing `etcdenvvar` controller and subcommands of the `cluster-etcd-operator`. By
  > eliminating this code it also removes the teams largest carry against upstream etcd.
  > - Ensuring that scale up only happens on control-plane nodes which have a quorum-guard pod monitoring health.
  > - Adding a flag to etcd which allows configuration of maximum learners in cluster (--max-learners). Today the max is 1.
  >
  > POC: Functional proof of concept: https://github.com/openshift/cluster-etcd-operator/pull/682

- [921](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/921): (20/20) general: Enhancement proposal for Network Observability (stleerh)

  > Network Observability introduces a new category in OpenShift that
  > provides networking information for a single cluster.  It gives insight
  > into what's on the network, when and what types of traffic and traffic
  > flows are being made, and by whom.  It gathers data to help design, plan,
  > and answer questions about the network and provides a visual representation
  > to help understand, diagnose, and troubleshoot networking issues.

- [922](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/922): (12/12) installer: Allow installer to include/exclude components based on user select install solution (bparees)

  > This enhancement proposes a mechanism for cluster installers to exclude one or more optional components for
  > their installation which will determine which payload components are/are not installed in their cluster.
  > Core components are defined as the set of Second Level Operators managed by the Cluster Version Operator
  > which today cannot be disabled until after completing the install and editing a CVO override, or editing
  > the CVO overrides as part of rendering+editing manifests.
  >
  > The proposed UX is to make this a first class part of the install config api with the implementation
  > being arguments supplied to the CVO to filter the user-selected manifests.

- [924](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/924): (33/33) oc: CLI Manager (deejross)

  > This proposal is describing the mechanism for how authors of a Command Line Interface (CLI) such as oc, kubectl, odo, istio, tekton, or knative,
  > can deliver tools to OpenShift clusters.  A feature is needed to manage various CLIs available for OpenShift and related services.  The goal is for
  >  a connected user to discover, install, and upgrade tools that are compatible with the current cluster version easily and from a single location.

- [925](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/925): (23/23) reliability: Kubelet<->Controller Manager communication Profiles (harche)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > To make sure Openshift cluster keeps running optimally under various circumstances where network latency, API Server latency, etcd latency, control plane load latency, etc. may not always be at their best (e.g. Edge cases), we can tweak the frequency of the status updates done by the `Kubelet` and the corresponding reaction times of the `Controller Manager` as well as `Kube API Server`.

- [926](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/926): (7/7) network: Proposal to allow mtu changes (jcaamano)

  > Customers may need to change the MTU post-installation. However these changes
  > aren't trivial and may cause downtime, hence the CNO currently forbids them.
  >
  > We propose a procedure that will be launched on demand. These procedure will
  > run pods on every node of the cluster and make the necessary changes in an
  > ordered and coordinated manner with a service disruption within the least
  > possible time and hopefully within TCP timeout (best effort).
