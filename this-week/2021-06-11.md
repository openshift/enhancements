## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Prioritized New pull request:

- [804](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/804): (17/17) workload-partitioning: PAO render initial draft (MarSik)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress, priority/important-soon`

  > The Performance addon operator is a day 2 optional operator installed via OLM. However the [Workload partitioning](management-workload-partitioning.md) feature needs to have some configuration ready at the installation time when PAO is not yet ready.
  > This feature is about adding a `render` mode to PAO that would allow an admin to pre-compute all the Openshift manifests that are needed in a way that prevents any typing mistakes from happening.
  > These generated manifests can then be passed to the installer and later taken over by the PAO reconcile loop.


### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [802](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/802): (29/31) workload-partitioning: WIP Workload partitioning API enhancement (MarSik)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress, priority/important-soon`

  > The overall feature summary is present in the [Management workload partitioning](workload-partitioning/management-workload-partitioning.md) feature. This document focuses on how the feature enablement API and its interactions will look like.

- [753](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/753): (18/59) workload-partitioning: add plan for configuration and enablement ownership (dhellmann)

  `priority/important-soon`

  > The initial iteration of workload partitioning focused on a short path
  > to a minimum viable implementation. This enhancement describes the
  > loose ends for preparing the feature for GA at a high level, and
  > explains the set of other design documents that need to be written
  > separately during the next iteration.
