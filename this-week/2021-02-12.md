## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized Merged Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Prioritized Merged pull request:

- [585](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/585): (12/146) update: EUS Upgrades MVP (sdodson)

  > This enhancement outlines a set of cross platform improvements meant to ensure
  > the safety of multiple back-to-back minor version upgrades associated with EUS
  > to EUS upgrades. Additionally, we outline improvements applicable to all
  > upgrades meant to reduce the duration of upgrades and workload disruption.
  >
  > All of the work detailed herein is prerequisite to enabling upgrades which skip
  > reboots. However where non-overlapping resources exist we can pursue reboot
  > removal in parallel such as the Node team validating upstream's stated Kubelet
  > version skew policies.


### Prioritized New Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Prioritized New pull requests:

- [641](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/641): (25/25) general: EP: Support for Cluster High-availability mode API (varshaprasad96)

  > The goal of this enhancement is to describe the support for [cluster high-availability mode API][enhancement_cluster_operators] introduced by OpenShift. The enhancement proposes to introduce necessary helper functions which will enable users to identify if the OpenShift cluster can support high availability deployment mode of their operator or not.

- [643](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/643): (5/5) update: Add Reduced Reboots enhancement (sdodson)

  > This enhancement is intended to reduce host reboots when upgrading across two or
  > more OpenShift minor versions by enabling an N-2 version skew policy between all
  > host components and cluster scoped resources.


### Prioritized Active Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [593](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/593): (39/107) general: Add proposal for hiding container mountpoints from systemd (lack)

  > The current implementation of Kubelet and CRI-O both use the top-level
  > namespace for all container and Kubelet mountpoints. However, moving these
  > container-specific mountpoints into a private namespace reduced systemd
  > overhead with no difference in functionality.

- [628](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/628): (29/50) general: automated resource request scaling (dhellmann)

  > This enhancement describes an approach to allow us to scale the
  > resource requests for the control plane services to reduce consumption
  > for constrained environments. This will be especially useful for
  > single-node production deployments, where the user wants to reserve
  > most of the CPU resources for their own workloads and needs to
  > configure OpenShift to run on a fixed number of CPUs within the host.
  >
  > One example of this use case is seen in telecommunication service
  > providers implementation of a Radio Access Network (RAN). This use case
  > is discussed in more detail below.


## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 4 Other Merged pull requests:

- [78](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/78): (4/91) general: Add "Build OKD-on-Fedora-CoreOS in Prow" proposal (LorbusChris)

  > OKD is the OpenShift community distribution of Kubernetes.
  >
  > As part of the version 4 effort, the OKD working group has decided to target Fedora CoreOS (FCOS) as the primary base operating system for OKD control plane and worker nodes.
  >
  > This document contains a proposal to add missing FCOS support to key components,
  > create OKD artifacts in OpenShift's Prow instance from the canonical OpenShift master and release branches alongside OCP CI artifacts,
  > and regularily create OKD release payloads from there.

  - [644](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/644): (5/5) general: OKD: Move proposal to `implementable`, clarify summary (LorbusChris)

- [473](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/473): (10/211) network: Enable IPsec support in OVNKubernetes (markdgray)

  > The scope of this work is to encrypt all traffic between pods on the cluster
  > network when that traffic leaves the node (and correspondingly decrypt traffic
  > that enters the node) using IPsec. It will *not* encrypt traffic between pods on
  > the host network, as this traffic does not traverse OVN. However, as a side
  > effect, this will also encrypt pod traffic that originates from pods on the host
  > network and is destined for the cluster network as this network does traverse
  > OVN. In order to simplify terminology, this encrypted traffic will be referred
  > to as inter-node traffic throughout the document.

- [608](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/608): (0/29) windows-containers: WINC-482: Bring Your Own Windows Host design (aravindhp)

  > The intent of this enhancement is to allow customers to add their existing
  > Windows instances to an OpenShift 4.7+ cluster using the Windows Machine Config
  > Operator (WMCO).




### Other New Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 7 Other New pull requests:

- [635](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/635): (8/8) manifestlist: IR-57: API changes for manifest list support (ricardomaraschini)

  > A manifest list is a group of image manifests, it is used to keep track of references
  > to images targeting different platforms/architectures in a single entity. OpenShift
  > does not support this type of manifest, it currently supports only an 1 to 1 mapping
  > (one manifest pointing to one image).
  >
  > This enhancement propose designs a plan to add support for this new type of manifest
  > in OpenShift.

- [636](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/636): (27/27) kube-apiserver: API Removal Notifications (sanchezl)

  > Notify customers that an API that will be removed in the next release is in use.

- [637](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/637): (169/169) monitoring: Add: Alerting Standards (michaelgugino)

  > Clear and actionable alerts are a key component of a smooth operational
  > experience.  Ensuring we have clear and concise guidelines for our alerts
  > will allow developers to better inform users of problem situations and how to
  > resolve them.

- [640](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/640): (2/2) ingress: Ingress: Add GCP Global Access LB Proposal (sgreene570)

  > This enhancement extends the IngressController API to allow the user to enable
  > the "Global Access" option for Ingress Controllers exposed via an Internal Load Balancer
  > on GCP.

- [642](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/642): (25/25) kubelet: Dynamic node sizing (harche)

  > Kubelet should have an automatic sizing calculation mechanism, which could give kubelet an ability to dynamically set sizing values for memory and cpu system reserved.
  >
  > Today the sizing values are passed manually to kubelet using `--kube-reserved` and `--system-reserved` flags. Many cloud providers provide reference values for their customers to help them select optimal values based on the node sizes. e.g. [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-architecture#memory_cpu),
  > [AKS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-clusters-workloads#resource-reservations)
  >
  > This enhancement proposes a mechanism to automatically determine the optimal sizing values for any node size irrespective of the cloud provider.

- [645](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/645): (6/6) update: eus-upgrades-mvp: Fix MCO constraints examples (sdodson)

  > This enhancement outlines a set of cross platform improvements meant to ensure
  > the safety of multiple back-to-back minor version upgrades associated with EUS
  > to EUS upgrades. Additionally, we outline improvements applicable to all
  > upgrades meant to reduce the duration of upgrades and workload disruption.
  >
  > All of the work detailed herein is prerequisite to enabling upgrades which skip
  > reboots. However where non-overlapping resources exist we can pursue reboot
  > removal in parallel such as the Node team validating upstream's stated Kubelet
  > version skew policies.

- [647](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/647): (2/2) windows-containers: Enhancement proposal for monitoring (VaishnaviHire)

  > The intent of this enhancement is to enable monitoring on Windows nodes created
  > by Windows Machine Config Operator(WMCO) in OpenShift cluster.
