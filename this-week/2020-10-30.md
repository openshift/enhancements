*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 7 Merged pull requests:

- [385](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/385): (0/2) rhcos: rhcos/extensions: Guidance on adding extensions (ashcrow)

  > This enhancement proposes a MachineConfig fragment like:
  > 
  > ```
  > extensions:   - usbguard
  > ```
  >
  > This is the OpenShift version of the [Fedora CoreOS extension system tracker](https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/401).
  >
  > That will add additional software onto the host - but this software will still be versioned with the host (included as part of the OpenShift release payload) and upgraded with the cluster.

- [425](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/425): (7/73) test-platform: describe e2e observer pods (deads2k)

  > e2e tests have multiple dimensions:
  > 1. which tests are running (parallel, serial, conformance, operator-specific, etc)
  > 2. which platform (gcp, aws, azure, etc)
  > 3. which configuration of that platform (proxy, fips, ovs, etc)
  > 4. which version is running (4.4, 4.5, 4.6, etc)
  > 5. which version change is running (single upgrade, double upgrade, minor upgrade, etc)
  > 
  > Our individual jobs are an intersection of these dimensions and that intersectionality drove the development of steps to help handle the complexity.
  >
  > There is a kind of CI test observer that wants to run across all of these intersections by leveraging the uniformity of OCP across all the different dimensions above. It wants to do something like start an observer agent of some kind for every CI cluster ever created and provide o(100M) of data back to include in the CI job overall. Working with steps would require integrating in multiple dimensions and lead to gaps in coverage.

- [448](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/448): (0/49) cluster-logging: Proposal to enable JSON data processing (lukas-vlcek)

  > This proposal opens possibility to route individual documents (logs) into different Elasticsearch indices based on data driven criteria.  Under the hood it utilizes Elasticsearch Ingesting [Pipeline Definition](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/pipeline.html) to dynamically inspect incoming documents and apply appropriate processor(s) such as [parsing JSON data](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/json-processor.html) in document field or pointing the document to a different index (similarly to [date-index-name-processor](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/date-index-name-processor.html)).
  >
  > This will enable indexing and storing of documents that carry custom data (such as JSON payload) into different index to avoid index mapping collisions and improves Elasticsearch querying and Kibana dashboarding experience.

- [500](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/500): (2/74) operator-sdk: Automated downstream Operator SDK into the OpenShift ecosystem. (jmrodri)

  > The Operator SDK currently ships the Ansible and Helm Operator base images downstream. The purpose of this enhancement is to add a supported Operator SDK base image as well as an operator-sdk binary. In addition, to add more automation to syncing upstream with downstream.

- [503](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/503): (0/2) windows-containers: WMCO upgrade enhancement update (sebsoto)

  > This enhancement allows a cluster administrator to upgrade a deployed Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO), and associated Windows node components, to a newer version.

- [510](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/510): (2/2) update: Define current installation profile name (guillaumerose)

  > Cluster profiles are a way to support different deployment models for OpenShift clusters.  A profile is an identifier that the Cluster Version Operator uses to determine which manifests to apply. Operators can be excluded completely or can have different manifests for each supported profile.

## New Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 New pull requests:

- [518](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/518): (0/0) cluster-logging: Enhancement proposal: Forwarding JSON logs. (alanconway)

  > A _JSON structured log_ is a series of _JSON objects_, each written on a single line. Each JSON object is called a log _message_.
  >
  > The logging system collects _meta-data_ (such as origin host, container-id, namespace) and combines it with the original _message_ to create a _record_. The envelope is forwarded and can be delivered to the output as a JSON object.
  >
  > There are use-cases for several different ways to combine message and meta-data. This proposal describes ClusterLogForwarder configuration and behavior to deal with each of them.
  >
  > This proposal is restoring functionality that was removed from previous versions [due to problems with Elasticsearch](https://github.com/openshift/origin-aggregated-logging/issues/1492). Some customers depended on it, and are unhappy. For description of the old feature see [Openshift 4.1 documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/logging/config/efk-logging-fluentd.html#efk-logging-fluentd-json_efk-logging-fluentd))

- [520](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/520): (0/0) network: Static IP Addresses from DHCP (cybertron)

  > In some OpenShift deployments, particularly Edge deployments, DHCP may not always be available for various reasons. To allow these deployments to function if they are not able to access the DHCP server, we have a request to configure the address(es) received from DHCP as static IPs on the deployed nodes. This would only be done if the lease received has an infinite length, so there is a reasonable expectation that it won't be reassigned.
