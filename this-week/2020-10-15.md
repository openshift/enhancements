As always, you can find past editions [on github](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/tree/master/this-week).

## Merged Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 4 Merged pull requests:

- [453](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/453): (0/45) network: Add a high level BGP use cases overview (russellb)

  > BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is a dynamic routing protocol used to power a number of important networking use cases, including routing in the global internet.  For some helpful resources on learning more about BGP, see the BGP Resources section of this document.
  >
  > The purpose of this document is to serve as a high level overview of how BGP relates to OpenShift.  We will review a number of use cases, discuss how they could be supported, and link to existing related work.  Any future enhancements related to BGP should be able to rely on this one to provide some broader context and should continue to update this document as necessary.

- [495](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/495): (8/12) baremetal: Updates to SLO for baremetal enhancement proposal (andfasano)

  > The `cluster-baremetal-operator` component will provide bare metal machine management capabilities needed for the Machine API provider on the `baremetal` platform. There is no equivalent for this component on other platforms.
  >
  > This functionality is currently provided by `machine-api-operator` directly via `baremetal-operator` from the Metal3 project, and related components. This situation requires the Machine API Operator to have significant bare metal specific knowledge.
  >
  > This proposal outlines a plan for a new bare metal specific component as a fully-fledged Second Level Operator under the management of the Cluster Version Operator.
  >
  > The new `cluster-baremetal-operator` will initially merely adopt the existing bare metal specific components - including `baremetal-operator` from `machine-api-operator`. However, we expect that additional bare metal specific functionality will be added to this new operator over time.

## New Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 4 New pull requests:

- [496](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/496): (72/72) metering: Add slim install metering enhancement (timflannagan1)

  > Due to the heavy footprint of the current Hadoop-based Metering Operator (Metering) stack, it's difficult to install in smaller clusters, like a demo or developer environment, which is affecting potential adoption and opens the door to replicating existing Metering functionality, with an in-house solution. This proposal outlines a path towards a slimmer Metering stack, both in terms of reducing the complexity and overall resource footprint, and is centered around replicating the properties that the Hadoop, Hive, and Presto components offer, with Postgresql acting as both the underlying storage and compute engine. This will allow Metering to set more reasonable defaults and reduces the barrier of entry when attempting to install Metering on smaller or medium-sized environments as it requires little-to-none user configuration.
  >
  > In addition to replacing the existing storage and compute layers, Metering will now utilize recording rules for its out-of-the-box Prometheus metrics it tracks, imports, and stores long term in Postgresql. Recording rules are a way to precompute frequent promQL queries, spreading the compute overhead over time, which increases Metering performance at query-time and reduces the query-time load on Prometheus. In the case a user wants to extend the reporting capabilities of Metering to track and store additional Prometheus metrics, those promQL queries will need to be evaluated on-demand at query-time instead of dynamically creating new recording rules.

- [497](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/497): (8/8) cloud-integration: Initial draft of Cloud Credentials Rotation. (dgoodwin)

  > Implement automatic credentials rotation in the cloud-credential-operator. Allow users to configure a global expiry duration for their cloud credentials config, after which the CCO will rotate new credentials in, and cleanup the old after a suitable period of time.

- [500](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/500): (0/0) operator-sdk: Automated downstream Operator SDK into the OpenShift ecosystem. (jmrodri)

  > The Operator SDK currently ships the Ansible and Helm Operator base images downstream. The purpose of this enhancement is to add a supported Operator SDK base image as well as an operator-sdk binary. In addition, to add more automation to syncing upstream with downstream.

- [501](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/501): (0/0) cluster-logging: LOG-928: Creating elasticsearch hot warm phase architecture proposal (ewolinetz)

  > The purpose of this is to increase the potential retention of our logs and maintain that they can still be queried. Currently our logs are either maintained as a high priority index or they are deleted. We seek to emulate the back-end process that Elasticsearch makes available in the form of [x-pack API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/index-lifecycle-management-api.html) end points.
