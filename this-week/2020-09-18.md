[360](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/360): (1/96) Quick Starts for Console

	      Introducing the Workflow Guides enhancement for the OpenShift
	      Console. The approach is different then the suggested Guided Tours.
	      Main difference is that the Guides are not hosted by the OpenShift
	      platform, but just linked to a GitHub repository. By utilising GitHubs
	      markdown, guide creators will have a proper tool for creating a step
	      by step guide for different area of interests (operators, workloads,
	      ...).

[463](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/463): (55/83) Describing steps to support out-of-tree providers

The migration of cloud provider implementations to separate repositories managed individually has been a long-standing issue. This enhancement explains the support plan for the OpenShift versions of those providers, to align with the upstream approach.

[471](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/471): (37/44) enhancement: Downstream Operator SDK
[452](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/452): (26/34) Add egress router EP

[369](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/369): (4/21) scheduling: Add new pod pod priority class
[411](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/411): (2/17) run the Assisted Installer on-premise as opposed to utilizing a cloud service

This enhancement builds on the work done previously for the [connected-assisted-installer](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/installer/connected-assisted-installer.md) to support running the workflow assistant in a user's data center, to avoid relying on cloud.redhat.com. This is the next step towards a completely disconnected version of the service and is part of the process of unifying the approach for bare metal deployments of OCP.

[448](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/448): (2/44) Proposal to enable JSON data processing
[438](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/438): (2/13) Add ingress fault detection proposal
