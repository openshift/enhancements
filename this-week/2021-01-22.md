# This Week in Enhancements - 2021-01-22

Beginning last week, we have started highlighting enhancements related to our top priorities for the upcoming releases.  To help with automating this, we are using the "priority/important-soon" label on these enhancements.  If you're working on an enhancement related to a release priority, you can help by applying this label with leaving a "/priority important-soon" label on the enhancement PR.

## Enhancements for Release Priorities

This section calls out enhancements that have been labeled with "priority/important-soon", which indicates the enhancement is related to a top-level release priority.

### Priorities - New Enhancements
*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

- [593](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/593): (46/46) general: Add proposal for hiding container mountpoints from systemd (lack)

  > The current implementation of Kubelet and CRI-O both use the top-level namespace for all container and Kubelet mountpoints. However, moving these container-specific mountpoints into a private namespace reduced systemd overhead with no difference in functionality.

- [596](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/596): (1/1) general: clarify wording about cluster machine approver for single-node production deployment approach (dhellmann)

There were 6 other Merged pull requests:

- [369](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/369): (0/57) scheduling: Add new pod priority class (lilic)

  > By default OpenShift has two reserved priority classes for critical system pods to have guaranteed scheduling, this proposal suggests the need for a third less critical priority class which would be used for user facing features we ship with OpenShift, for example user workload monitoring pods, that are not system critical but should have a higher scheduling priority than any user workloads.

  > [Amazon CloudWatch][aws-cw] is a hosted monitoring and log storage service. This proposal extends the `ClusterLogForwarder` API with an output type for CloudWatch.
