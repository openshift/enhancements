This is the third weekly edition of this experiment to provide a weekly digest
newsletter of activity in the OpenShift enhancements repository.

## Merged Enhancements

*<PR ID>: (reviews this week / total reviews) summary*

There were 4 Merged pull requests:

[297](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/297): (4/14) Template: add specific guidance in upgrade/downgrade section

	      Capture some more specific guidance on upgrade/downgrade expectations
	      to help authors think through their scrnarios.

	      In https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1794360 we see an example of debate
	      around our expectations for handling downgrades and rollbacks. The
	      conclusions there are good examples of the kind of information that
	      is useful to add to the template.

[399](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/399): (2/57) [machine-config-operator/baremetal] MCO declarative network configuration

	      Enhancement proposal to extend MCO for declaritive network
	      configuration.

This is a very interesting enhancement that has had a long discussion.
[399](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/399) is a continuation of
[161](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/161), which was originally
filed in December of 2019.

The enhancement addresses how we can provide a declarative configuration
interface for the network configuration of RHCOS hosts in a way that is
compatible with our existing OpenShift architecture.  Configuring network
interfaces on Linux is far from new, but how we model and expose it in
OpenShift is not trivial.  See the [host network
configuration](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/host-network-configuration.md)
document for a higher level discussion of this problem space in OpenShift.

The original proposal was to adopt
[kubernetes-nmstate](https://github.com/nmstate/kubernetes-nmstate) and
[nmstate](https://github.com/nmstate/nmstate) to present host network
configuration through the Kubernetes API and apply changes as needed.  This
model seemed to be working well as a generally useful add-on for Kubernetes
cluster.

The design review process helped highlight an important architectural conflict.
We desire to have host configuration owned by the Machine Config Operator
(MCO).  Introducing `kubernetes-nmstate` would leave us with another component
managing a subset of host configuration completely outside the view of the MCO,
resulting in potential conflicts that we have no way to resolve.

Over several months, engineers collaborated to explore different alternative
approaches before settling on one that still provides the API features we
desire, but also fits well with the MCO.  While different approaches of deep
integration were considered, the final approach has the components peacefully
co-exist with known and defined interactions between them.
