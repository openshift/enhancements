  > The `encryption-config` used by OpenShift API server to
  > encrypt/decrypt resources will also be used by the new
  > `oauth-apiserver` for one release `(4.6)` and will be split in the
  > next `(4.7)`, in order to allow seamless upgrade and downgrade of
  > encrypted servers. Initially `OAS-O` will be responsible to manage
  > both servers. In the future releases `CAO` will take over the
  > config and will manage its operand.

## New Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 5 New pull requests:

- [531](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/531): (12/12) update: Distribute channel description strings (wking)

  > We have [official documentation for channels and their intended semantics][channel-docs], but not all customers read the docs.
  >
  > This enhancement proposes an API which update services may use to declare channels and associated metadata, and a path for propogating that data into clusters, where tooling like [`oc adm upgrade [channel]`][oc-adm-upgrade-channel] and [the web console][web-console-channel] can expose them to users as they are considering channel choices or the resulting update recommendations.
  >
  > This is similar to [available-update metadata](available-update-metadata.md), but for different data.

- [532](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/532): (54/54) storage: vSphere monitoring operator (jsafrane)
