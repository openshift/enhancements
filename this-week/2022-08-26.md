  > * cluster-csi-snapshot-controller-operator and its operand, csi-snapshot-controller.
  > * cluster-storage operator and its operand aws-ebs-csi-driver-operator and its operand AWS EBS CSI driver.
  >   * All other CSI driver operators + CSI drivers should follow the same approach, AWS EBS is just the first one to
  >     run its control plane in HyperShift's management cluster.

- [1150](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1150): (7/125) general: User experience workflow in OCP CoreOS Layering model and phased approach (sinnykumari)

  > Since the last time, we have gained experience while working
  > on the prototype in the layering branch https://github.com/openshift/machine-config-operator/tree/layering
  > and discussing/demoing to different teams.
  >
  > Goal is to have up-to-date information of the existing
  > enhancement and sketch how the user experience will look like
  > in the layering model.
  >
  > **Note** There will be some additional update added to this PR by the authors of this enhancement when spikes mentioned in this doc has been completed.

- [1200](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1200): (20/130) network: Pods SNAT to LB Service IP proposal (oribon) ([SDN-2682](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SDN-2682))

  > Some external systems that communicate with applications running on the Kubernetes cluster through a LoadBalancer service expect that the source IP of egress traffic originating from the pods backing the service is identical to the destination IP they use to reach them - i.e the LoadBalancer's ingress IP.
  > This behavior requires that service access from outside the cluster will only work to a designated node. This is contradictory to how default services work where a service may be accessed via any node.
  >
  > By annotating a LoadBalancer service, users could request that the source IP of egress packets originating from all of the pods that are endpoints of it would be its ingress IP.

- [1216](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1216): (20/72) dev-guide: OCPSE-25: [dev-guide] Cluster Fleet Evaluation (aravindhp)

  > Introduce a process that allow OpenShift components to introduce a change that could result in highly visible alerts, breakages or upgrade failures on user clusters.
