# This Week in Enhancements - 2021-1-15

## 4.8 Priorities

### Single Node OpenShift

Two Enhancements merged this week related to single node OpenShift, with updates after they merged.

- [560](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/560): (38/174) general: single-node production deployment approach (dhellmann)

  > This enhancement describes the approach to deploying single-node
  > production OpenShift instances without using a cluster
  > profile. With a few changes to existing operators that would also
  > be needed for a profile-based approach, and with the
  > high-availability mode API described in
  > [#555](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/555), it is
  > possible to produce single-node deployments without introducing a
  > new cluster profile.

  - [587](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/587): (0/0) general: add risk about disruptive changes to single-node-production-deployment-approach (dhellmann)

- [555](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/555): (36/195) general: Cluster High-availability Mode API (dhellmann)

  > As we add more deployment topologies for OpenShift, we need a way to communicate expectations to the operators managing the cluster. This enhancement describes an API for telling operators how hard to work to provide high-availability of their operands.

  - [584](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/584): (0/0) general: Update Infrastructure topology from SingleNode to SingleReplica (ravidbro)

### EUS-to-EUS Upgrades

There was 1 new enhancement for the EUS-to-EUS upgrade initiative this week.

- [585](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/585): (17/17) update: EUS Upgrades MVP (sdodson)

  > This enhancement outlines a set of cross platform improvements meant to ensure the safety of multiple back-to-back minor version upgrades associated with EUS to EUS upgrades. Additionally, we outline improvements applicable to all upgrades meant to reduce the duration of upgrades and workload disruption.
  >
  > All of the work detailed herein is prerequisite to enabling upgrades which skip reboots. However where non-overlapping resources exist we can pursue reboot removal in parallel such as the Node team validating upstream's stated Kubelet version skew policies.

### Central Machine Management

There was active discussion of 1 enhancement for the central machine management initiative.

- [574](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/574): (31/216) installer: First iteration of running the Assisted Installer in end-user clusters. (mhrivnak)

## Merged Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 other Merged pull requests:

- [424](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/424): (0/0) authentication: updates Separate-OAuth-API-Resources enhancement to reflect the current state of the world (p0lyn0mial)

  > The API resources used by the OpenShift OAuth server will be moved to their own `oauth-apiserver` repository. The oauth-apiserver binary will be managed by the existing authentication-operator.

- [430](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/430): (0/24) network: Proposal for networkpolicy for multus interface (i.e. net-attach-def) (s1061123)

  > This proposal to bring networkpolicy features for multus interface.

- [518](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/518): (6/92) cluster-logging: Enhancement proposal: Forwarding JSON logs. (alanconway)

  > When applications write structured JSON logs, consumers want to access fields of JSON log entries for indexing and other purposes. The current logging data model stores the log entry as a JSON *string*, not a JSON *object*. Consumers can't access the log entry fields without a second JSON parse of this string.
  >
  > This proposal will allow alternate structured forms of output record

### Minor Updates Merged

## New Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 other New pull requests:

- [577](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/577): (45/45) ingress: describe one-stop-shopping for exposing customized routes (deads2k)

  > Add `CustomizeableRoute{Spec,Status}` to `IngressSpec` in a way that allows multiple operators to provide information about Routes (or Ingresses, or maybe even something else), that a cluster-admin wants to provide custom names and/or custom serving certificates for.

- [581](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/581): (7/7) network: WIP Add Netflow support proposal (rcarrillocruz)

  > NetFlow is a protocol developed by Cisco for collecting IP traffic information and monitoring network flow. It is widely used by network departments.
  >
  > OVS (Open vSwitch) has supported NetFlow for quite some time now. OpenShift uses OVN/OVS for OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.  OpenShift should have the ability to export cluster traffic as NetFlow data.
