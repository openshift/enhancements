- [571](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/571): (43/43) network: Cloud API component for egress IP (alexanderConstantinescu)

  > OVN-Kubernetes and openshift-sdn today support the feature egress
  > IP on bare-metal platforms. Going forwards OpenShift will need to
  > support the feature on conventional cloud provider platforms (such
  > as: GCP, AWS, Azure). Cloud providers require additional
  > management of the egress IP address via the cloud provider's cloud
  > API. That is required since the cloud provider will not let the
  > network plugin claim an additional IP on the node, which it does
  > not recognize.
  >
  > To be able to do this we will need to add logic (to either a dedicated component or to the network plugins themselves) as to be able to handle this. This enhancement proposal concerns itself with a discussion surrounding questions such as:
  >
  > - If the component should be generic enough as to allow other
  >   resources the capability to talk to the cloud API and modify
  >   host/cluster configurations? If the answer is yes, then we
  >   probably need an separate enhancement proposal for that, as this
  >   one only goes into the details of additional IP address
  >   assignment (within the scope of egress IP) - If the component
  >   should be a dedicated OpenShift component / upstream one? - If
  >   something existing in Kubernetes/OpenShift already exists which
  >   satisfies the requirements specified in this document? Certain
  >   resources have been found in the initial investigation leading
  >   to this enhancement proposal, which seem to indicate such. It is
  >   however not abundantly clear what those components do, and what
  >   their limitations are, see: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]
  >
  > Moreover, this document goes into detail concerning:
  >
  > - The cloud provider data model required as to manage egress IP assignments in   the cloud - The model and interaction between this future entity, the network plugin and   any additional component required for this interaction to happen.
  >
  > OpenShift 4.8 aims to support egress IP assignments on Azure and
  > AWS. GCP is targeted for OpenShift 4.9. This document tries
  > however to make an abstraction from the requirements and deadlines
  > set for each cloud w.r.t. each OpenShift release. Hence it does
  > not solely focus on AWS or Azure, but instead aims at defining an
  > architecture which is cloud agnostic and which would be applied
  > with minimal implementation efforts for additional clouds.

- [574](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/574): (185/185) installer: First iteration of running the Assisted Installer in end-user clusters. (mhrivnak)

  > The Assisted Installer currently runs as a SaaS on cloud.redhat.com, enabling users to deploy OpenShift clusters with certain customizations, particularly on bare metal hardware. It is necessary to bring those capabilities on-premise in users' clusters for two purposes:
  >
  > 1. A cluster created by the Assisted Installer needs the ability to add workers on day 2. 2. Multi-cluster management, such as through hive and ACM, should be able to utilize the capabilities of the Assisted Installer.
  >
  > This enhancement proposes the first iteration of running the Assisted Installer in end-user clusters to meet the purposes above.

- [575](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/575): (29/29) installer: Installer Enhacement Proposal: Manifests from STDIN (oglok)

  > In many occasions, users need to customize the install-config target and/or the manifests generated by the OpenShift Installer in a reproducible manner. The most popular tool to allow this type of customization is “Kustomize”, and it is already well-known by the Kubernetes ecosystem. The result of any “Kustomization” is sent to standard output as a stream of manifests.
  >
  > This OpenShift enhancement proposes to allow the installer to read a stream of manifests from STDIN on the main targets that consume manifests.

- [576](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/576): (0/0) cluster-logging: Move ES cert management into Elasticsearch Operator (ewolinetz)

  > Currently to use the Elasticsearch Operator, one would need to
  > generate secrets in a specific manner which creates a high amount
  > of complexity for use. This proposal seeks to outline a mechanism
  > where the Elasticsearch Operator creates and maintains these
  > certificates and the elasticsearch/kibana secret instead of other
  > operators (e.g. Cluster Logging and Jaeger), and allows an
  > annotation mechanism on secrets for injecting required keys and
  > certificates for mTLS with Elasticsearch.
