# This Week in Enhancements - 2021-10-15

## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [838](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/838): (7/137) local-storage: KNIP-1770: Add proposal for exporting local storage device health metrics (rohantmp)

  `priority/important-soon`

  > This enhancement proposes that we export health metrics for each local device on each node.

- [867](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/867): (2/164) node-tuning: Move PAO to OCP enhancement (MarSik)

  `priority/important-soon`

  > The [Performance Addon Operator](https://github.com/openshift-kni/performance-addon-operators) is a component that makes it easier to configure an OCP cluster for low latency and real-time purposes [OCP docs](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/scalability_and_performance/cnf-performance-addon-operator-for-low-latency-nodes.html).
  > It is a high level orchestrator that consumes a [Performance Profile](https://github.com/openshift-kni/performance-addon-operators/blob/master/docs/interactions/performance-profile.yaml) and generates multiple manifests that are then processed by core OpenShift components like MCO and NTO.
  > We have a simplified interaction diagram here: https://github.com/openshift-kni/performance-addon-operators/blob/master/docs/interactions/diagram.png
  > A more in depth description of how a low latency tuned cluster works was presented at DevConf 2021: https://devconfcz2021.sched.com/event/gmJD/openshift-for-low-latency-and-real-time-workloads
  >
  > The proposal in hand is to move the existing implementation of PAO under
  > [cluster node tuning operator (NTO)](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-node-tuning-operator) without adding new features.


## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Other Merged pull requests:

- [871](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/871): (2/116) baremetal: Enable Baremetal on other Platforms to support centralized host management (asalkeld)

  > Baremetal Host API is only available when deploying an OpenShift cluster with the baremetal
  > platform (via the IPI or AI (Assisted Installer) workflow). Having the ability to
  > manage baremetal hosts from clusters without requiring the cluster to be on baremetal
  > would be beneficial to customers.

- [887](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/887): (22/83) ingress: NE-542 Expose router compression variables (candita)

  > This enhancement proposal extends the IngressController API to allow the cluster administrator
  > to configure HTTP traffic compression via HAProxy variables.  HTTP traffic compression increases the
  > performance of a website by reducing the size of data that is passed in HTTP transactions.
