- [1193](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1193): (25/115) microshift: USHIFT-40 Default CNI for MicroShift (mangelajo) ([USHIFT-40](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-40))

  > This enhancement proposes the adoption of a default MicroShift CNI.
  >
  > MicroShift addresses customer use cases with low-resource,
  > field-deployed edge devices (SBCs, SoCs) requiring a minimal K8s
  > container orchestration layer, please see PR#1187 for more details.
  >
  > We are proposing OVNKubernetes to align with all the other OpenShift form factors,
  > and provide the ability to use NetworkPolicies which some customers demand.
  >
  > In this enhancement we describe the changes made to the OVNKubernetes configuration
  > as well as the work that needs to be done, and possible improvements.

- [1202](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1202): (67/225) storage: STOR-962: Update storage operators for HyperShift (jsafrane) ([STOR-962](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/STOR-962))

  `priority/important-soon`

  > This enhancement describes how OCP storage components will run in HyperShift's managed control plane and in the guest
  > cluster.
  >
  > The components currently are:
  >
  > * cluster-csi-snapshot-controller-operator and its operand, csi-snapshot-controller.
  > * cluster-storage operator and its operand aws-ebs-csi-driver-operator and its operand AWS EBS CSI driver.
  >   * All other CSI driver operators + CSI drivers should follow the same approach, AWS EBS is just the first one to
  >     run its control plane in HyperShift's management cluster.

There were 3 Other Merged pull requests:

- [1170](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1170): (155/571) olm: Add a platform operators (phase 0) proposal (timflannagan) ([OLM-2232](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OLM-2232)) ([OLM-2513](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OLM-2513)) ([OLM-2605](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OLM-2605))

  > Previous 4.x releases kickstarted the "Composable OpenShift" initiative by allowing users to disable a subset of existing CVO-based components that are [non-essential](#non-essential-operators) to the payload before cluster creation. This enhancement outlines the next iteration of this initiative, and introduces a mechanism that enables support for managing platform operators.
  >
  > A platform operator (PO) is an OLM-based operator that can be installed during day zero operations, and participates in the [cluster's lifecycle](#cluster-lifecycle). Introducing this mechanism will be delivered in phases.
  >
  > > Note: this enhancement will be focused on the first phase, denoted phase 0, which will be delivered through tech preview guidelines.
  >
  > The first phase is centered around introducing a basic PO mechanism for installing existing OLM-based operators, and help build the foundational layer for subsequent phases. Given the high source of engineering effort needed to accomplish the eventual delegation of optional, CVO-based operators to OLM over time, phase 0 will include a slimmed down scope, and restrict which OLM-based operators
  > can
  > be installed through this new mechanism. These restrictions are documented in more detail below.
  >
  > A key goal for POs is to influence the [cluster lifecycle](#cluster-lifecycle). During phase 0, this means that OLM-based operators will be installed during day zero operations, and block cluster rollout when an individual PO fails to install successfully.
  > Support for automatically upgrading PO packages after cluster rollout is out-of-scope for this proposal. Future phases will iron out this participation model further.
  >
  > Extending this PO mechanism to support any optional, CVO-based components is also out-of-scope for this phase. Future iterations of "Composable OpenShift" will start to onboard these existing payload components to OLM's management, and the requisite migration process for these components will be documented in more detail in future phase enhancements.
  > This migration may require existing payload components to re-package their manifests into one of the OLM supported registry+v1 (or plain+v1) bundle formats, and onboard to the CPaaS pipeline in order to build and release on their own schedule.

There were 6 Other New pull requests:

- [1212](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1212): (2/2) hypershift: Enhancment to support HostedClusterInfrastructure CRD (jnpacker) ([ACM-1554](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-1554))

  > This enhnacement was born out of the Untangling HypershiftDeployment, HostedCluster and NodePool document (see glossary). With the deprecation (removal) of HypershiftDeployment for GA, ACM/MCE requires a means to track and manage Infra for Cloud Providers for its primary user Cluster Administrator (multi-service cluster administrator).
  > HostedClusterInfrastructure would be used to provision or track Cloud Provider infrastructure objects that can be used when provisioning HostedClusters using those providers.

- [1213](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1213): (71/71) workload-partitioning: feat: add wide cluster configuration for workload partitioning (eggfoobar) ([CNF-5562](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNF-5562))

  > This enhancements builds on top of the [Management Workload
  > Partitioning](management-workload-partitioning.md) and the [move of PAO in
  > NTO](../node-tuning/pao-in-nto.md) enhancement to provide the ability to do
  > workload partitioning to our wider cluster configurations. The previous workload
  > partitioning work is isolated to Single Node cluster configurations, this
  > enhancement will seek to allow customers to configure workload partitioning on
  > HA as well as Compact(3NC) clusters.

- [1216](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1216): (54/54) dev-guide: OCPSE-25: [dev-guide] Cluster Fleet Evaluation (aravindhp)
