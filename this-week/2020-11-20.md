There were 5 Merged pull requests:

- [429](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/429): (4/98) kube-apiserver: Enforce label scheme (mmirecki)

  > This enhancement intends to provide a way to define, per project, labels and annotations that should be enforced in all resources of a given type created in the particular project (v.s. having those possibly  pre-defined in helm chart). The labels could be specified per project, resource type, resource name.

- [508](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/508): (1/45) console: Add Customize Developer Catalog Categories enhancement (jerolimov)

  > The OpenShift Console provides a "Developer Catalog" which enables the user to create apps and services based on Operator backed services, helm charts, templates, etc.
  >
  > Cluster admins can provide additional catalog items by installing operators or adding helm repositories. But the filter categories (Languages, Databases, Middleware, CI/CD) are hard coded. This enhancement enable cluster admin to customize these category filters.

- [532](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/532): (18/72) storage: vSphere problem detector (jsafrane)

  > Below we propose to check if OpenShift clusters installed into vSphere environment is / can be fully functional by introducing a new operator and periodical checks.

- [537](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/537): (12/12) api-review: Update the unqualified-search-registries enhancement (umohnani8)

  > Today, the cluster-wide Image CR (images.config.openshift.io cluster) doesn't have a way of setting the registry search order when pulling an image using short name.
  >
  > With the move to v2 /etc/containers/registries.conf, there is a new option called `unqualified-search-registries`. This is the list of registries that the container tools will check when pulling an image using its short name.

## New Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 6 New pull requests:

- [538](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/538): (1/1) machine-api: update machine-api-usage-telemetry (elmiko)

  > This enhancement proposes utilizing alerts and metrics exposed
  > through telemetry to improve our understanding of how users are
  > operating the Machine API components. By reporting the amount of
  > activity with the Machine API we can understand the basic usage
  > patterns that exist within the OpenShift fleet. Correlating this
  > data with alerting information about failures and remediations
  > will provide opportunities for prescriptive guidance and insight
  > into infrastructure stability.

- [540](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/540): (24/24) machine-config: Installer/MCO: store pointer ignition customizations in MachineConfig (hardys)

  > This enhancement proposes changing the way installer ignition customizations are stored, so that instead of storing the modified pointer ignition in a Secret we include the user changes in a MachineConfig, such that the MCO can manage it, and it is included in the MCO rendered config.

- [541](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/541): (46/46) scheduling: Scheduling profiles (damemi)

  > This enhancement proposes a new field in the `schedulers.config.openshift.io/v1` API to allow configuration of enabled and disabled scheduler plugins via defined profiles.
  >
  > This will simplify how users configure pod scheduling beyond the default set of enabled plugins in the default scheduler managed by the OpenShift operator.

- [542](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/542): (23/23) general: Add enhancement for phase 0 AWS STS support in installer and CVO operators. (dgoodwin)

  > Add support for using time limited AWS Security Token Service
  > credentials in OpenShift Installation and all core CVO managed
  > operators. This enhancement will avoid the need to use long lived
  > traditional AWS access key ID / secret access key credentials at
  > any point during the lifecycle of the cluster. Support will
  > require manual setup, but once complete tokens will be
  > automatically rotated and made available to affected OpenShift
  > operators.

- [543](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/543): (6/6) update: extend design for how the CVO knows the cluster profile (guillaumerose)

  > Cluster profiles are a way to support different deployment models for OpenShift clusters.  A profile is an identifier that the Cluster Version Operator uses to determine which manifests to apply. Operators can be excluded completely or can have different manifests for each supported profile.

- [544](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/544): (6/6) kubelet: describe kubelet credentials for authn/authz (deads2k)

  > Kubelets need to be individually authenticated so that they can be individually authorized. Individual authentication and authorization allows for fine-grained API access control which limits API access to only those resources required to run the pods scheduled on a particular node. For example, kubelets can only read secrets that are mounted by pods scheduled to the node running the kubelet.
