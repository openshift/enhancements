- [1524](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1524): (4/4) cluster-logging: Add multi-cluster-observability-addon proposal (periklis) ([OBSDA-356](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OBSDA-356)) ([OBSDA-393](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OBSDA-393)) ([LOG-4539](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4539))

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > Multi-Cluster Observability has been an integrated concept in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) since its inception but only incorporates one of the core signals, namely metrics, to manage fleets of OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) based clusters (See [RHACM Multi-Cluster-Observability-Operator (MCO)](rhacm-multi-cluster-observability)). The underlying architecture of RHACM
  > observability consists of a set of observability components to collect a dedicated set of OCP metrics, visualizing them and alerting on fleet-relevant events. It is an optional but closed circuit system applied to RHACM managed fleets without any points of extensibility.
  >
  > This enhancement proposal seeks to bring a unified approach to collect and forward logs and traces from a fleet of OCP clusters based on the RHACM addon facility (See Open Cluster Management (OCM) [addon framework](ocm-addon-framework)) by enabling these signals events to land on third-party managed and centralized storage solutions (e.g. AWS Cloudwatch, Google Cloud Logging). The
  > multi-cluster observability addon is an optional RHACM addon. It is a day two companion for MCO and does not necessarily share any resources/configuration with the latter. It provides a unified installation approach of required dependencies (e.g. operator subscriptions) and resources (custom resources, certificates, CA Bundles, configuration) on the managed clusters to collect and forward logs
  > and traces. The addon's name is Multi Cluster Observability Addon (MCOA).

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress, jira/valid-reference`

  > This enhancement outlines an API/mechanism for users to define what actions to take upon a MachineConfigOperator driven change (e.g. a file change via a MachineConfig object). By default, all changes to MachineConfig fields require a drain and reboot. The user can use this new API, a RebootPolicy, to specify which MachineConfig changes to not disrupt their workloads.

- [1526](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1526): (2/2) cluster-logging: Update forwarder-input-selectors.md (jcantrill) ([LOG-2155](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2155))

  > Cluster Logging defines a set of well known log sources in order to facilitate configuration of log collection and normalization.  Given customers are no longer bound to the data storage provided by cluster logging, this enhancement expands those definitions to allow specifying which logs are collected by using Kubernetes metadata.
  >
  >
  > Logs originate from six distinct sources and are logically grouped using the following definitions:
  >
  >
  > * **Application** are container logs from all namespaces across the cluster excluding infrastructure namespaces.
  >
  >
  > * **Infrastructure** logs are:
  >   * container logs from namespaces: default, kube*, openshift*
  >
  >
  > * **Audit** are logs written to files on master nodes that include:
  >   * kubernetes API server
  >   * OpenShift API server
  >   * auditd
  >   * OVN
  >
  >
  > **NOTE**: **application**, **infrastructure**, and **audit** are reserved words to the **cluster-logging-operator** and continue to represent the previous definitions.
  >
  >
  > Administrators use these definitions to specify pipelines to normalize and route messages from the sources to outputs.
  >
  >
  > This enhancement allow administrators to define "named" inputs by expanding the previous definitions as follows:
  >
  >
  > * Named application:
  >   * Any name that is not reserved
  >   * Collect from any namespace including the ones for **infrastructure** container logs
  > * Named infrastructure:
  >   * Any name that is not reserved
  >   * Explicit source choices of: node, container
  > * Named audit:
  >   * Any name that is not reserved
  >   * Explicit source choices of: kubeAPI, openshiftAPI, auditd, ovn
