*Updates since 2022-07-15*


## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Prioritized New pull request:

- [1193](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1193): (57/57) microshift: USHIFT-40 Default CNI for MicroShift (mangelajo) ([USHIFT-40](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-40))

  `priority/important-soon`

  > This enhancement proposes the adoption of a default MicroShift CNI.
  >
  > MicroShift addresses customer use cases with low-resource,
  > field-deployed edge devices (SBCs, SoCs) requiring a minimal K8s
  > container orchestration layer.
  >
  > MicroShift is targeting a class of devices like Xilinx ZYNQ
  > UltraScale+, fitlet2, NVIDIA Jetson TX2, or Intel NUCs that are
  > pervasive in edge deployments. These cost a few hundred USD, have all
  > necessary accelerators and I/O on-board, but are typically not
  > extensible and are highly constrained on every resource, e.g.:
  >
  > * CPU: ARM Cortex-A35-class or Intel Atom class CPU, 2-4 cores, 1.5GHz clock
  > * memory: 2-16GB RAM
  > * storage: e.g. SATA3 @ 6Gb/s, 10kIOPS, 1ms (vs. NVMe @ 32Gb/s,
  >   500kIOPS, 10Âµs)
  > * network: Less bandwidth and less reliable than data center-based
  >   servers, including being completely disconnected for extended
  >   periods. Likely 1Gb/s NICs, potentially even LTE/4G connections at
  >   5-10Mbps, instead of 10/25/40Gb/s NICs


### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Prioritized Active pull request:

- [1187](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1187): (107/177) microshift: kubernetes for device edge (dhellmann) ([OCPPLAN-9080](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPPLAN-9080)) ([USHIFT-50](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-50))

  `lgtm, priority/important-soon`

  > This enhancement describes MicroShift, which provides an essential
  > container orchestration runtime compatible with Kubernetes and
  > OpenShift built for Internet-of-things (IoT) and Edge computing
  > scenarios that are constrained in CPU, memory, and network bandwidth.  The container
  > orchestration runtime is binary compatible with OpenShift Container
  > Platform, but it is not 100% API resource compatible.  It has a strict
  > subset of OpenShift API resources pertinent for IoT and Edge computing
  > scenarios with a strong bias to retaining traditional runtime security
  > controls like SecurityContextConstraints and SELinux.

### Other Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Other Merged pull requests:

- [1014](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1014): (107/600) multi-arch: Heterogeneous architecture clusters (Prashanth684) ([RFE-2240](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RFE-2240)) ([OCPPLAN-4577](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPPLAN-4577))

  > This enhancement describes the plan to support provisioning and upgrades of heterogeneous architecture Openshift clusters.
  > A heterogeneous cluster is a cluster with nodes running on different architectures with a homogeneous control plane and worker machinesets
  > supporting any combination of architectures (eg: x86 control plane + a mix of ARM/P/Z worker nodes). This document describes the support
  > needed for heterogeneous architecture clusters in phases. There will be three major phases with basic support in phase 1 which is targeted
  > for a 4.11 techpreview (with documented limitations) and the other phases which address gaps beyond the 4.11 time frame. The targeted platform
  > for the initial phase is Azure with support for x86 and ARM architectures.
