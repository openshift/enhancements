*Updates since 2022-07-22*


## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Prioritized Merged pull request:

- [1187](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1187): (3/178) microshift: kubernetes for device edge (dhellmann) ([OCPPLAN-9080](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPPLAN-9080)) ([USHIFT-50](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-50))

  > This enhancement describes MicroShift, which provides an essential
  > container orchestration runtime compatible with Kubernetes and
  > OpenShift built for Internet-of-things (IoT) and Edge computing
  > scenarios that are constrained in CPU, memory, and network bandwidth.  The container
  > orchestration runtime is binary compatible with OpenShift Container
  > Platform, but it is not 100% API resource compatible.  It has a strict
  > subset of OpenShift API resources pertinent for IoT and Edge computing
  > scenarios with a strong bias to retaining traditional runtime security
  > controls like SecurityContextConstraints and SELinux.

  `priority/important-soon`

  > This enhancement proposes the adoption of a default MicroShift CNI.
  >
  > MicroShift addresses customer use cases with low-resource,
  > field-deployed edge devices (SBCs, SoCs) requiring a minimal K8s
  > container orchestration layer, please see PR#1187 for more details.
  >
  > We are proposing OVNKubernetes to align with all the other OpenShift form factors,
  > and provide the ability to use NetworkPolicies which some customers demand.
  >
  > In this enhancement we describe the changes made to the OVNKubernetes configuration
  > as well as the work that needs to be done, and possible improvements.

  > This proposal fleshes out the details for the current Node lifecycle solution for HyperShift form factor i.e. hosed control planes.
  > This includes automated Machine management, OS and config lifecycle.

  `ok-to-test`

  > This enhancement provides a proposal for integrating vDPA (Virtio Data Path Acceleration) in Openshift.

- [1200](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1200): (2/2) network: Pods SNAT to LB Service IP proposal (oribon) ([SDN-2682](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SDN-2682))

  > Some external systems that communicate with applications running on the Kubernetes cluster through a LoadBalancer service expect that the source IP of traffic originating from the pods backing the service is identical to the destination IP they use to reach them - i.e the LoadBalancer's external IP (the ingress IP).
  > In addition, traffic to and from these pods should be able to use any network interface on the host.
  >
  > By annotating a LoadBalancer service, users could request that the source IP of packets originating from all of the pods that are endpoints of it would be its external IP. They could also specify from which network the pods' traffic should exit from.
  > This mechanism will be supported only on clusters using OVN-Kubernetes on "Local Gateway Mode".
