#### Prioritized Merged Pull Requests Modifying Existing Documents

- [892](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/892): (5/6) general: document PR life-cycle timeouts (dhellmann)

### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [867](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/867): (10/150) node-tuning: Move PAO to OCP enhancement (MarSik)

  `priority/important-soon`

  > The [Performance Addon Operator](https://github.com/openshift-kni/performance-addon-operators) is a component that makes it easier to configure an OCP cluster for low latency and real-time purposes [OCP docs](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/scalability_and_performance/cnf-performance-addon-operator-for-low-latency-nodes.html).
  > It is a high level orchestrator that consumes a [Performance Profile](https://github.com/openshift-kni/performance-addon-operators/blob/master/docs/interactions/performance-profile.yaml) and generates multiple manifests that are then processed by core OpenShift components like MCO and NTO.
  > We have a simplified interaction diagram here: https://github.com/openshift-kni/performance-addon-operators/blob/master/docs/interactions/diagram.png
  > A more in depth description of how a low latency tuned cluster works was presented at DevConf 2021: https://devconfcz2021.sched.com/event/gmJD/openshift-for-low-latency-and-real-time-workloads
  >
  > The proposal in hand is to move the existing implementation of PAO under
  > [cluster node tuning operator (NTO)](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-node-tuning-operator) without adding new features.

- [838](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/838): (2/127) local-storage: KNIP-1770: Add proposal for exporting local storage device health metrics (rohantmp)

  `priority/important-soon`

  > This enhancement proposes that we export health metrics for each local device on each node.

- [593](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/593): (1/137) general: Add proposal for hiding container mountpoints from systemd (lack)

  `lifecycle/stale, priority/important-soon`

  > The current implementation of Kubelet and CRI-O both use the top-level
  > namespace for all container and Kubelet mountpoints. However, moving these
  > container-specific mountpoints into a private namespace reduced systemd
  > overhead with no difference in functionality.


## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 5 Other Merged pull requests:

- [748](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/748): (12/25) cluster-logging: LOG-1296: Send JSON logs from containers in the same pod to separate indices (alanconway)

  > Elasticsearch needs log messages with different formats to be directed to different indices.
  > The ClusterLogForwarder API can direct logs from diffeent _pods_ to different Elasticsearch indices, based on namespace or labels, using the `structuredTypeKey` field.
  >
  > This proposal is only about forwarding structured JSON logs to Elasticsearch, but the pattern described here may be useful in other situations.

### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 11 Other New pull requests:

- [894](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/894): (33/33) authentication: authentication/login-logout: initial enhancement (s-urbaniak)

  > This enhancement describes capturing login, login failure, and logout events in the OpenShift authentication subsystems.

- [895](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/895): (10/10) builds: WIP - Build CSI Volumes (adambkaplan)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > This proposal extends the build [Volume Mounted Resources](volume-mounted-resources.md) feature to support
  > [CSI ephemeral volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/ephemeral-volumes/#csi-ephemeral-volumes).

- [899](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/899): (2/2) authentication: pod-security initial commit (s-urbaniak)

  > (no '## Summary' section found in enhancements/authentication/pod-security-admission.md)

- [900](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/900): (2/2) network: Multus service abstraction enhancement (s1061123)

  > This proposal introduces an implemention of Kubernetes services for secondary network interfaces, which are created by multus CNI. Currently pods' secondary network interfaces made by multus a sidecar to the Kubernetes network, henceforth Kubernetes network functionality cannot be used, such as network policy and service. This proposal introduces several components into OpenShift in order to
  > implement some of the Kubernetes service functionality for pods' secondary network interfaces.

- [902](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/902): (4/4) kubelet: Add initial OpenShift swap enhancement (ehashman)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > The upstream Kubernetes 1.22 release introduced alpha support for configuring swap memory usage for Kubernetes workloads on a per-node basis.
  >
  > Now that swap use on nodes is supported in upstream, there are a number of use cases that would benefit from OpenShift nodes supporting swap, including improved node stability, better support for applications with high memory overhead but smaller working sets, the use of memory-constrained devices, and memory flexibility.

- [905](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/905): (16/16) hypershift: Introduce konnectivity-socks5-proxy enhancement (awgreene)

  > The goal of this enhancement is to provide [HyperShift](https://github.com/openshift/hypershift/) control plane services the ability to establish [GRPC](https://grpc.io/) connections with servers running on guest clusters.

- [907](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/907): (1/1) console: CONSOLE-2894: Multi-cluster console (spadgett)

  > OpenShift console is currently a single-cluster console. Today, users who work
  > in environments with multiple clusters must switch between consoles for each
  > cluster. We want to make OpenShift console multi-cluster aware. Users should be
  > able to visit one console running on the hub cluster and easily switch between
  > spoke clusters in the fleet without leaving that console or logging in again.
  >
  > Additionally, we want to integrate the OpenShift and ACM consoles so that they
  > are a single console under a single URL. This hybrid console will have an "All
  > clusters" perspective that contains the ACM multi-cluster views. Selecting a
  > cluster from the cluster dropdown will drill down into the traditional
  > OpenShift console views for that cluster.

- [908](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/908): (40/40) kube-apiserver: Improving Supportability of API Webhooks (sttts)

  > OpenShift supports the API extensions that upstream Kubernetes has built into the kube-apiserver.
  > This especially involves webhooks for admission and for CRD conversion. This enhancement is about
  > measures to increase supportability of clusters that use official Red Hat provided add-ons (like
  > Istio, kubevirt or Open Policy Agent), but also 3rd-party add-ons (like Vault, or the community
  > variants of previously mentioned software).

- [909](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/909): (4/4) baremetal: Include CoreOS ISO in the release payload (zaneb)

  `lgtm`

  > The baremetal platform is switching from a QCOW2 format for its CoreOS image to
  > an ISO. To ensure that existing disconnected clusters can update to this, the
  > ISO image will be included in the release payload. This will be balanced out by
  > removing the RHEL image currently shipped in the release payload. There are
  > many other nice benefits, such that after future upgrades clusters will
  > provision new machines with the latest CoreOS, without requiring an extra
  > reboot.
