### Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 8 Merged pull requests:

- [1456](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1456): (11/329) network: SDN-4035: IPAM for VMs for OVN Kubernetes secondary networks (maiqueb) ([SDN-4035](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SDN-4035))

  > This enhancement proposal focuses on tying IP address allocation to Virtual
  > Machines instead of the pods where they run. In short, the IP allocation
  > should be available during the Virtual Machine lifecycle, rather than the
  > lifecycle of the pod where it runs on.

- [1490](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1490): (8/238) machine-config: MCO-811: MachineConfigNode introduction for MCO State Reporting (cdoern) ([MCO-452](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MCO-452))

  > This enhancement describes how Nodes and their upgrade processes should be aggregated by the MCO into a user facing object. The goal here is to allow customers and the MCO team to decipher our processes in a more verbose way, speeding up the debugging process and allowing for better customer engagement.

- [1513](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1513): (2/94) cluster-logging: Added enhancements/cluster-logging/content-filter.md (alanconway) ([LOG-2155](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2155))

  > Allow users to reduce the volume of log data by:
  > 1. Dropping unwanted log records completely.
  > 2. Pruning unwanted fields from log records.
  >
  > The new prune/drop content filters use the same framework as the kube-api-audit filter.
  > This framework can be extended with new types of filters in future.
  >
  > **NOTE**: Content filters are distinct from input selectors.
  > Input selectors select or ignore entire log _streams_ based on _source metadata_.
  > Content filters _edit_ log streams (remove and modify records) based on _record content_.

- [1545](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1545): (9/215) microshift: USHIFT-2186: Multus CNI for MicroShift (pmtk) ([OCPSTRAT-473](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPSTRAT-473))

  > Currently MicroShift ships [ovn-kubernetes](https://github.com/openshift/ovn-kubernetes) (ovn-k)
  > CNI responsible for connectivity within and outside the cluster.
  > There are users that have needs beyond what ovn-k offers like adding more interfaces to the Pods.
  > Some example requirements are connecting Pods to the host's bridge interface or setting up complex networking based on VLAN.
  > This functionality is Multus' trademark - adding additional interfaces to Pods.
  >
  > This enhancement explores providing Multus CNI as an optional component to MicroShift.

- [1551](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1551): (115/147) microshift: USHIFT-2196: User-facing audit-log configuration (copejon) ([USHIFT-2196](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-2196))

  > Add ability for MicroShift users to configure API server audit logging policies, log rotation and retention.

- [1562](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1562): (23/86) microshift: USHIFT-2348: microshift y-2 upgrades (dhellmann) ([USHIFT-2246](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-2246))

  > This enhancement describes how MicroShift will support upgrading
  > in-place across 2 minor versions at a time.

- [1576](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1576): (3/3) housekeeping: clean up owners file (dhellmann)

  > * Remove approvers who are no longer org members
  > * Add tool to automatically check approvers list against org membership

### New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 11 New pull requests:

- [1566](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1566): (38/38) general: observability: Add logging-stack with UI and korrel8r integration (periklis) ([LOG-5114](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-5114))

  > This document proposes a solution and a delivery plan for a unified installation and upgrading procedure of the logging for Red Hat OpenShift product (short OpenShift Logging) as well as auxiliary UI and correlation (See [korrel8r](korrel8r)) components via the [Cluster Observability Operator](cluster-observability-operator)(COO). The proposed solution is intended to complement the existing
  > OpenShift Logging stack managed by the [Cluster Logging Operator](cluster-logging-operator)(CLO) and the [Loki Operator](loki-operator)(LO). Furthermore the proposal aims to be a blueprint approach for other OpenShift Observability products (i.e distributed tracing, network observability, power monitoring).

- [1567](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1567): (9/9) network: SDN-4154:Add troubleshooting section for upgrades to OVN IC (ricky-rav) ([SDN-3905](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SDN-3905))

  `jira/valid-reference`

  > Allow any upgrade path that proceeds via a 4.13 self-hosted or hypershift-hosted cluster to smoothly upgrade to 4.14, which features OVNK InterConnect (IC) multizone.

- [1569](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1569): (8/8) insights: Insights Rapid Recommendations proposal (tremes) ([CCXDEV-12213](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CCXDEV-12213)) ([CCXDEV-12285](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CCXDEV-12285))

  > The Insights Operator collects various data and resources from the OpenShift and Kubernetes APIs.
  > The definition of the collected data is mostly hardcoded in the operator's source code and largely
  > locked in the corresponding OCP version.
  >
  > This proposal introduces remote Insights Operator configuration for collected data.
  > The feature will allow Red Hat to control what data the Insights Operator gathers,
  > within hardcoded boundaries, independently of the cluster version.

- [1571](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1571): (22/22) update: Add Change Management and Maintenance Schedules (jupierce)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > Implement high level APIs for change management which allow
  > standalone and Hosted Control Plane (HCP) clusters a measure of configurable control
  > over when control-plane or worker-node configuration rollouts are initiated.
  > As a primary mode of configuring change management, implement an option
  > called Maintenance Schedules which define reoccurring windows of time (and specifically
  > excluded times) in which potentially disruptive changes in configuration can be initiated.
  >
  > Material changes not permitted by change management configuration are left in a
  > pending state until such time as they are permitted by the configuration.
  >
  > Change management enforcement _does not_ guarantee that all initiated
  > material changes are completed by the close of a permitted change window (e.g. a worker-node
  > may still be draining or rebooting) at the close of a maintenance schedule,
  > but it does prevent _additional_ material changes from being initiated.
  >
  > A "material change" may vary by cluster profile and subsystem. For example, a
  > control-plane update (all components and control-plane nodes updated) is implemented as
  > a single material change (e.g. the close of a scheduled permissive window
  > will not suspend its progress). In contrast, the rollout of worker-node updates is
  > more granular (you can consider it as many individual material changes) and
  > the end of a permitted change window will prevent additional worker-node updates
  > from being initiated.
  >
  > Changes vital to the continued operation of the cluster (e.g. certificate rotation)
  > are not considered material changes. Ignoring operational practicalities (e.g.
  > the need to fix critical bugs or update a cluster to supported software versions),
  > it should be possible to safely leave changes pending indefinitely. That said,
  > Service Delivery and/or higher level management systems may choose to prevent
  > such problematic change management settings from being applied by using
  > validating webhooks.

- [1572](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1572): (3/3) storage: STOR-1764: Add enhancement for CSI fixes in cloud-provider-azure code (bertinatto) ([STOR-1764](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/STOR-1764))

  `jira/valid-reference`

  > Azure cloud logic from embedded in Azure CSI drivers rely on the
  > `cloud-provider-azure` dependency.  As a result of that, many bug
  > fixes to Azure CSI drivers go into that dependency.  However, for
  > older version of OCP, bumping that dependency results in too many code
  > changes, increasing the risk of introducing new issues on the CSI
  > drivers.  As a result, we need a way to address specific issues in
  > `cloud-provider-azure` without risking the overall stability of the
  > CSI drivers.

- [1574](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1574): (2/2) image-registry: Use Bound Tokens for Integrated Image Registry Authentication (sanchezl)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > Use bound service account tokens to generate image pull secrets for pulling from the integrated image registry. Instead of creating the secrets needed to create long-lived service account tokens, bound service account tokens are generated directly via the TokenRequest API. Using the TokenRequest API will reduce the number of secrets and improve the security posture of a cluster.

- [1577](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1577): (3/3) machine-config: MCO-1049: Introduces On-Cluster-Build API, machineOSBuild, and machineOSImage (cdoern) ([MCO-665](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MCO-665))

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress, jira/valid-reference`

  > This enhancement describes the user facing API for On-Cluster-Builds. Currently, there is no way to track the in-depth state of a build. The only mechanism the MCO has is a few additional MCP level condition types. Not only is state hard to follow but setup of an On-Cluster-Build system involves creating 2 secrets and 2 seprate configmaps referencing these secrets.
  >
  > With this API we aim to consolidate both the configuration of our image builds and the state pertaining to the build itself as well as the resulting image which the MCO then manages. a MachineOSBuild will in-turn cause the creation of a MachineOSImage. Since the MachineOSImage is created during an update process, we will also need to augment the MachineConfigNode object to be aware of these
  > types of updates.
  >
  > A MachineOSBuild will contain the image push and pull secrets for access to the registry and containerfile data for a user to specify custom data they want built into the image. The other fields will be set by the MCO mainly the name of the resulting machineOSImage. In the Status we will have conditions, the build start and end time, related failed/interrupted builds and why they failed, and
  > the final pull spec of the created image.
  >
  > a MachineOSImage will have the base image, the pull spec, the MCP the image is associated with and the rendered MachineConfig this image is based off of all in the spec. The status will contain an observed generation, conditions, an image age, a custom "rollout status" to tell the user where the image is being rolled out and how it is going, and finally an "image usage status" detailing the
  > part of the lifecycle this image is in for garbage collection.

- [1578](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1578): (10/10) api-review: Add ManagedClusterVersion CRD (2uasimojo)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > Introduce a new namespaced openshift/api CustomResourceDefinition,
  > `ManagedClusterVersion`, as a vehicle for managers of OpenShift fleets to
  > expose version and upgrade information in the management cluster.
