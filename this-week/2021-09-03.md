# This Week in Enhancements - 2021-09-03

There is an ongoing project to revamp the design document review
process in this repository. As part of that, there is currently a
proposal to [clean up old enhancement
PRs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mF8wBs9lJAE6-kZlSm4bUTMbksmTC6Mi097Q4O_jvEQ/edit#). If
you have an interest in our design review process, please take a few
minutes to read that document.

  `priority/important-soon`

  > This enhancement proposes a mechanism for blocking edges for the subset of clusters considered vulnerable to known issues with a particular update or target release.

- [838](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/838): (33/110) local-storage: KNIP-1770: Add proposal for exporting local storage device health metrics (rohantmp)

## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 4 Other Merged pull requests:

- [751](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/751): (23/159) builds: Disable Jenkins Pipeline Build Strategy by Default (adambkaplan)

  > OpenShift 3.0 included a way to invoke a Jenkins pipeline from an OpenShift build.
  > The status of the build on the OpenShift cluster would reflect the state of the pipeline in Jenkins.
  > This was the first feature to support continuous integration/delivery processes on OpenShift.
  >
  > As OpenShift and Kubernetes have evolved, so has cloud-native CI/CD.
  > Tekton and its downstream distribution - OpenShift Pipelines - provide a way of running CI/CD processes natively on Kubernetes.
  > The Jenkins pipeline strategy was officially deprecated in OpenShift 4.1, but at that time there was no meaningful replacement.
  > We now have that meaningful replacement with the general availability of OpenShift Pipelines.
  >
  > To discourage use of the Jenkins pipeline strategy, this proposal will disable runs of Jenkins Pipeline builds by default.
  > Clusters which rely on the Jenkins pipeline strategy can enable it through cluster's build controller configuration API (`build.config.openshift.io/cluster`).

- [806](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/806): (21/21) ingress: Add ingress operator and operand logging level API (sgreene570)

  > This enhancement describes the API and code changes necessary to expose
  > a means to change the Ingress Operator and OpenShift Router's Logging Levels to
  > cluster administrators.
