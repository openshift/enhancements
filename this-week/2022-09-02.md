- [1202](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1202): (3/228) storage: STOR-962: Update storage operators for HyperShift (jsafrane) ([STOR-962](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/STOR-962))

  `priority/important-soon`

  > This enhancement describes how OCP storage components will run in HyperShift's managed control plane and in the guest
  > cluster.
  >
  > The components currently are:
  >
  > * cluster-csi-snapshot-controller-operator and its operand, csi-snapshot-controller.
  > * cluster-storage operator and its operand aws-ebs-csi-driver-operator and its operand AWS EBS CSI driver.
  >   * All other CSI driver operators + CSI drivers should follow the same approach, AWS EBS is just the first one to
  >     run its control plane in HyperShift's management cluster.

  > The purpose of this enhancement is to provide an API in the cluster-dns-operator which will allow cluster
  > admins to configure durations for successful (positive) and unsuccessful (negative) caching of DNS query responses.
  > The scope of the configured durations are for all configured server blocks in CoreDNS' Corefile including the
  > default zone.

- [1229](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1229): (2/2) hypershift: PSAP-742: Enable node tuning of HyperShift hosted nodes via NTO (dagrayvid) ([PSAP-742](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PSAP-742))

  > This enhancement describes how the [Node Tuning Operator (NTO)](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-node-tuning-operator) will run in HyperShiftâ€™s managed control plane to manage tuning of hosted cluster nodes via the containerized TuneD daemon.
  > The required changes can be summarized into the following three phases.
  >
  > Phase 1: Enable NTO to be used for setting sysctls via TuneD and managing default tunings applied to hosted cluster nodes:
  > - HyperShift repo:
  >   - Enable deploying NTO in the control plane namespace via the control-plane-operator. NTO will have two kubeconfigs for accessing the hosted and management clusters.
  >   - Add `spec.tunedConfig` field to the NodePool API. Similarly to the `spec.config` field, it will be a list of references to ConfigMaps in which Tuned manifests are stored.
  >   - Reconcile `spec.tunedConfig` in the NodePool controller. Embed the Tuned configuration into a ConfigMap per NodePool in the control plane namespace.
  > - Node Tuning Operator repo:
  >   - NTO needs to support the option of having two kubeconfigs
  >   - NTO needs to know whether it is running in HyperShift (based on env variable)
  >   - When running in HyperShift, NTO needs to get Tuneds from the ConfigMap(s) in the hosted control-plane namespace and create the Tuned objects in the hosted cluster (reconciling the Tuneds in the Hosted Cluster to always match those in the ConfigMap(s))
  >   - NTO needs to create the operand (containerized TuneD daemon) and Profile objects in the Hosted Cluster.
  >
  > Phase 2: Enable NTO to be used for setting kernel boot arguments calculated by TuneD on hosted cluster nodes
  > - HyperShift repo:
  >   - Watch and reconcile NTO-generated (by the operator) ConfigMaps containing MachineConfigs for setting kernel parameters.
  > - Node Tuning Operator repo:
  >   - Change NTO to embed generated MachineConfigs for setting kernel parameters into ConfigMaps with a specific label that will get picked up by the NodePool controller.
  >   - Change NTO to label these ConfigMaps by NodePool.
  >
  > Phase 3 (4.13+): Enable Performance Addon Operator / PerformanceProfile controller functionality.
  > In OCP 4.11 the Performance Addon Operator -- which is owned by the CNF team -- has been merged into the Node Tuning Operator, as a separate controller running under the same binary.
